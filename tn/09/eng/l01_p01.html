                From a very early age, I played tennis-ball
                cricket with my colony friends. I loved watching
                cricket on television and in our games,
                I often tried to emulate the mannerisms of
                my favourite players, Sunil Gavaskar and
                the West Indian legend Viv Richards. But it
                wasn't just the batsmen that I studied. I also
                loved bowling. Throughout my career, I have
                actually bowled a lot in the nets.
