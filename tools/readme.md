* The IMM division of the CME includes such currencies as the U.S. dollar, the British pound, the euro, and the Canadian dollar. Along with currencies, the IMM trades the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR), the 10-year Japanese bond, and the U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI).

* History of the International Monetary Market (IMM)
The Chicago Mercantile Exchange was founded in 1898. Its original name was the "Chicago Butter and Egg Board" although it changed its name in 1919. The CME was the first financial exchange to "demutualize" and become publicly traded in 2002. In 1961, the CME launched its first futures market for frozen pork bellies. In 1969, it added financial futures and currency contracts. The first interest rate, bond, and futures contracts commenced in 1972.

* According to its 2019 annual report, the CME on average handles an average daily volume of 19.2 million contracts, a slight decline from 2018.

* While some trading continues to take place in the traditional open outcry method, 80% of trading is done electronically through its CME Globex electronic trading platform.
