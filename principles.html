        <h5>Guidelines</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Please! Take care of all the kids!</li>
          <li>Don't compare a child with another child. Every child is unique</li>
          <li>Don't compare time or result. Every child faces inexplicable challenges!</li>
          <li>Motivate them to practice everyday at the same time!</li>
          <li>They will gradually move up, don't need to push them too much!</li>
          <li>Please exercise care, encouragement of a kid, shouldn't demotivate other kids!</li>

        <h5>Why Maths?</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>We can't explore space/ocean without mathematics</li>
          <li>To save people from pandemic, drugs are validated by mathematical model before government approves!</li>          
          <li>Future needs more mathematicians than any other fields</li>
          <li>We don't need costly lab to learn mathematics, pen and paper is enough! (Example: Russia doesn't have same
            resource as America, still they do better as they love maths)</li>
          <li>Everything under the sun can be measured, there is a profession for it!</li>
          <li>Professional mathematicians are important, respected and celebrated by society! We see less of them!</li>
          <li>Mathematicians can't bluff as they have to prove with valid proof and validated by other mathematicians
            from relevant domains!</li>
          <li>There are more jobs for mathematicians than any other fields!</li>

        <ol>          
          <li>Every subject can have opinion, mathematics requires proof!</li>
          <li>Don't compare with other kids, but teach them daily practice!</li>
          <li>Create online groups! Appreciate kids for their daily practice!</li>
          <li>Parents could enourage and buy gifts for continious 21/42/84 days of practice!</li>
          <li>Emphasize importance of practice, let result take its own course of time!</li>
