# Activity

## What is an Activity?

* The **Activity** class is a crucial component of an Android app
* Android system initiates code in an **Activity instance**
* An activity provides the window in which the app draws its UI
* Most apps contain multiple screens, which means they comprise multiple activities
* Typically, one activity in an app is specified as the **main activity**, which is the **first screen** to appear when the user launches the app
* Each activity can then start another activity in order to perform different actions
* For example, the main activity in a simple e-mail app may provide the screen that shows an e-mail inbox. From there, the main activity might launch other activities that provide screens for tasks like writing e-mails and opening individual e-mails.
* To use activities in your app, you must **register** information about them in the **appâ€™s manifest**, and you must manage **activity lifecycles** appropriately.

## Defining the Activity in AndroidManifest.xml file

* **AndroidManifest.xml**

```xml
<manifest ... >
  <application ... >
      <activity android:name=".MainActivity" />
      ...
  </application ... >
  ...
</manifest >
```

## Activity LifeCycle

![alt](images/003-activity_lifecycle.png)

* **onCreate()**
  * You must implement this callback, which fires when the system first creates the activity
* **onStart()**
  * The onStart() call makes the activity visible to the user, as the app prepares for the activity to enter the foreground and become interactive
  * For example, this method is where the app initializes the code that maintains the UI.
* **onResume()**
  * When the activity enters the Resumed state, it comes to the foreground, and then the system invokes the onResume() callback. **This is the state in which the app interacts with the user**
* **onPause()**
  * The system calls this method as the first indication that the **user is leaving your activity** (though it does not always mean the activity is being destroyed)
* **onStop()**
  * When your activity is **no longer visible to the user**, it has entered the Stopped state, and the system invokes the onStop() callback
  * This may occur, for example, when a newly launched activity covers the entire screen
  * The system may also call onStop() when the activity has finished running, and is about to be terminated.
* **onRestart()**
  * When user enters the application screen again from another application
* **onDestroy()**
  * onDestroy() is called before the activity is destroyed. The system invokes this callback either because:
    * the activity is finishing (due to the user completely dismissing the activity or due to finish() being called on the activity), or
    * the system is temporarily destroying the activity due to a configuration change (such as device rotation or multi-window mode)

## Sample Activity Class

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        //UI initialization code...
    }

    @Override
    protected void onStart(){
        super.onStart();
        Log.d("First App - Log", "In the onStart()");
    }
    @Override
    protected void onResume() {
        super.onResume();
        Log.d("First App - Log", "In the onResume()");
    }
    @Override
    protected void onPause() {
        super.onPause();
        Log.d("First App - Log", "In the onPause()");
    }
    @Override
    protected void onStop() {
        super.onStop();
        Log.d("First App - Log", "In the onStop()");
    }
    @Override
    protected void onRestart() {
        super.onRestart();
        Log.d("First App - Log", "In the onRestart()");
    }
    @Override
    protected void onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy();
        Log.d("First App - Log", "In the onDestroy()");
    }

}
```
