## What is a Kernel?

* The kernel is a computer program at the core of a computer's operating system and generally has complete control over everything in the system.

* It is the portion of the operating system code that is **always resident in memory** and facilitates interactions between hardware and software components

* The kernel is one of the first programs **loaded on startup (after the bootloader)**. It handles the rest of startup as well as memory, peripherals, and input/output (I/O) requests from software, translating them into data-processing instructions for the central processing unit

* An oversimplification of how a kernel connects application software to the hardware of a computer
