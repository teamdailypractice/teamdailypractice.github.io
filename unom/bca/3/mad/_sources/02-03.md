# Intents

* An Intent is a messaging object you can use to request an action from another app component. 
* Although intents facilitate communication between components in several ways, there are three fundamental use cases

## Intents Use cases

* **Starting an activity**
  * Start a new instance of an Activity by passing an `Intent` to `startActivity()`
  * The `Intent` describes the activity to start and carries any necessary data
* **Starting a service**
  * A Service is a component that performs operations in the background without a user interface
  * Example service: **JobScheduler**
* **Delivering a broadcast**
  * A broadcast is a message that any app can receive
  * Example Broadcast: System broadcasts for system events like **mobile device starts charging**
  
## Intent types

There are two types of intents:

* **Explicit intents** specify which application will satisfy the intent, by supplying either the target app's package name or a fully-qualified component class name

**Implicit intents** do not name a specific component, but instead declare a general action to perform, which allows a component from another app to handle it
