# Fragments

* A **Fragment** represents a reusable portion of your app's UI
* Fragments enable to break the activity into different sections
* A fragment defines and manages its own layout, has its own lifecycle, and can handle its own input events
* Fragments cannot live on their own. They must be hosted by an activity or another fragment
* The fragment’s view hierarchy becomes part of, or attaches to, the host’s (Parent activity/fragment) view hierarchy
* Fragments introduce modularity and reusability into activity’s UI by allowing to divide the UI into discrete chunks

## Fragment class - Example

```java
class ExampleFragment extends Fragment {
    public ExampleFragment() {
        super(R.layout.example_fragment);
    }
}
```

## How to add a Fragment to the Activity/Fragment?

* Add a fragment via XML
* Add a fragment programmatically

## Fragment Lifecycle

* Each Fragment instance has its own lifecycle.
* Each possible Lifecycle state is represented in the `Lifecycle.State` enum
  * INITIALIZED
  * CREATED
  * STARTED
  * RESUMED
  * DESTROYED
* A `Fragment` must be added to `FragmentManager`
