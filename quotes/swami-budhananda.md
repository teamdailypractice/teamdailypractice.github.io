# Anger

## Introduction

Everyone of us, except for a rare few, has experienced that passion called anger - its fury and flames, its madness and infernal energy. Some of us continue to be permanent victims of the tragedy brought about by it.

Not all those who have experienced anger are seeking to know how to overcome it - many even rationalize their anger, and would go any length to justify it, both to themselves and to others, as if the welfare of the world depended on their anger. These days it is also intellectually fashionable to speak approvingly of the 'angry generation', as if anger, which is considered destructive at the individual level, when collectivized, becomes a commendable virtue. In fact, anger has become a modern social ethos, a political weapon, a collective ploy for upsetting the status quo, and useful material for revolution - a kind of unconventional vested interest. The under-privileged sections of society, particularly their leaders, organized labour, student's unions etc., deliberately use the idiom of anger, as a strategy for action, or a keynote for bargaining: 'Do this or face the consequences.' And it would appear that it works!

Some people also seem to consider anger to be a kind of masculine virtue and wear it as a badge of leadership--for being regarded as the boss among a-social or anti-social elements. In the underworld of criminals, refrigerated anger is a status symbol. Any time, at will, he can get it out of the ice-box and get it heated on the stove of his design:

     His nose should pant 
     And his lips should curl, 
     His cheeks should flame 
     And his brow should furl, 
     His bosom should heave 
     And his heart should glow, 
     And his fist be ever ready 
     For a knock down blow. 

How fantastically anger is hymned! Their philosophy can be put in a nutshell in these words: 'Rage supplies all with arms. When an angry man thirsts for blood, anything will serve him as a spear.'

In advertisements, newspapers, electronic media etc., we see anger and violence depicted in great detail. Mental food of this kind cannot but have a harmful effect on the general public. Yet there is hardly any protest against this marketing of anger as a commodity. It is necessary therefore to examine the phenomenon of anger both in its social and individual aspects, before devising strategies to overcome it.

## Anger and Its Effects

Let us examine some definitions of anger. 'Anger is momentary madness.' Another unusual definition is: 'Anger is a mirror into which you do not venture to see your own face.' The Oxford dictionary defines anger as 'extreme displeasure'. Swami Turiyananda regarded anger as concentrated desire.

While a precise definition of anger may prove elusive, everyone more or less knows what anger is, since it is pretty ubiquitous. We meet anger at home, in the streets, offices, social gatherings, election booths, legislative assemblies, play grounds, international meets, and most frequently, within ourselves.

Anger, oftener than not, is apt to cause more harm to oneself than to others. As anger issues out of man's own nature, it is a natural and a forceful emotion, with great destructive potential. As in every piece of wood there is hidden fire, so there is hidden anger in every human being, because of the 'Rajas' constituent of his/her nature. All are susceptible to anger - mildly, or strongly so. Anger is contagious. Words ignited by anger can cause anger in others. Soothing words are the water hydrants needed when passions are inflamed.

The evil effects of anger are innumerable The first thing that happens to an angry person is that he forgets the lessons of wisdom he has learnt in life. After that he loses control over his thoughts and emotions. He becomes over-active, with his highly charged ego, as his only guide. He loses his power of discrimination, sense of proportion, and becomes aggressive in manner, hostile to his own welfare. When anger becomes the second nature of a person, physical health and equanimity of mind suffer and inner peace vanishes in a trice. Anger can destroy friendships, families, business partnerships, professional prospects. Communal and ethnic riots, arsons, wars, suicides, murder, and many other forms of crime are basically products of anger. In fact. anger makes even a handsome person look ugly. I suggested to a friend who is remorseful about his flashes of anger, that he keep a large mirror facing his office desk. In case the anger-prone person has a lively sense of humour, this mirror-therapy is likely to work.
