# Anger

* In life, almost everything repeats more than once. Is it so?
* Everything = behaviour of myself towards others, behaviour of others towards me and all other events in the world
* **behaviour = thoughts, words, actions**
* Think about it in my own life experience (past events, behaviour)
* If an event or behaviour (words, actions), occurs once, Can I be sure that there is a potential possibility of the same event or behaviour occurring again, may be in the same form or in a different form? Does it repeat most of the time consciously or unconsciously without my control?
* If a behaviour should not be repeated by myself, what should I do?
* Analyze the behaviour
* What caused the behaviour?
* Why?
* **Is the behaviour good for my physical health?**
* **Is behaviour good for my mental health?**
* **Is behaviour good for my family members, environment?**
* **Is there an alternative way? Is there a better way?**
* Do I want to behave in the same way, When I am 40/50/60/70/80+?
* How do I want to behave When I am 40/50/60/70/80+?
* Does it come automatically or do I need to practice?
* Is there anything in life that is worth having it, did I practice for a period of time or did it come suddenly one day and stick with me forever?
* If I need to change my behaviour for the good to myself how should I go about it?
* Why do I need it?
* How do I acquire it, practice it and keep it?
* How do I use it daily? Do I really use it?
* If I don't use any skill that I learned/acquired, do I lose it eventually?
* If something can be acquired in a day, can it also be lost in a day?
* If I get something without any effort, is there a possibility it may also lost without any effort?
* **Nature's law = Whatever I practice and put my effort, I will eventually get the result/fruit of it**
* What do I want?
* Why?
* Do I practice it daily?
* Do I really deserve it?

## Anger - Perspective from Buddhism

* It doesn't matter how many times I repeat **I wonâ€™t get angry**
* **Without actual effort**, I will never achieve the peace of mind I wish for. It will be only a wish
* **With daily effort and practice, the wish will come true in my life**
* Acting out on anger makes it easier to do so again in the future. Anger repeats most of the time

* An action could trigger a death of someone (myself/my close beings/others). Is it true?
* Should I understand the need to transform/change anger to compassion, love in my life?
* Anger is the most dangerous than all of the world's bombs and guns and knives put together. Why?
* In United States, we heard about past events of shooting in Children schools. What caused it?
* Is it true, that someone seeding, growing (repeats more than once) anger towards something (event, behaviour - words, actions) and finally expressed it?
* Consciously - seeding, growing
* Unconsciously - seeding, growing
* Do both of the above finally yields the result?

* You are the first victim of your own anger
* In a controversy, the instant we feel anger, we have already ceased striving for the truth, and have begun striving for ourselves

* Do not dwell in the past, do not dream of the future, concentrate the mind on the present moment
* It is better to conquer yourself, than to win a thousand battles. Then the victory is yours
* We are shaped by our thoughts, we become what we think. When the mind is pure, joy follows like a shadow that never leaves. Work out your own salvation. Do not depend on other
* **Dalai Lama**
* Anger or hatred is like a fisherman's book. It is very important for us to ensure that we are not caught by it
* More often than not, anger is actually an indicationof weakness rather than of strength
* Anger cannot be overcome by anger. If someone is angry with you and you show anger in return, the result is a disaster.

* **Is Anger Beneficial? - Thubten Chodron, from Working with Anger**
* We generally consider something beneficial if it promotes happiness
* But when we ask ourselves, **"Am I happy when I'm angry?"**
* The answer is undoubtedly no. We may feel a surge of physical energy due to physiological reasons, but emotionally we feel miserable. Thus, from our own experience, we can see that anger does not promote happiness
* In addition, we don't communicate well when we're angry. We may speak loudly as if the other person were hard of hearing or repeat what we say as if he had a bad memory, but this is not communication. Good communication involves expressing ourselves in a way that the other person understands. It is not simply dumping our feelings on the other
* Good communication also includes expressing our feelings and thoughts with words, gestures, and examples that make sense to the other person. **Under the sway of anger, however, we neither express ourselves as calmly nor think as clearly as usual**
* Under the influence of anger, we also say and do things that we later regret. **Years of trust built with great effort can be quickly damaged by a few moments of uncontrolled anger.** If we could tame our anger, such painful consequences could be avoided
