AND ITS CONTROL 



*mi Budf 



The control of the mind 
Is not a problem peculiar 
to religious aspirants ; people 
in all walks of life need to 
control their minds if they 
are to succeed in their 
vocation. No fundamental 
work for the uplift of the 
individual or the community 
can ever be done without 
mind-control. 

This book which sets forth 
the teachings of Vedanta 
and Yoga on the nature of 
the mind and ways of con- 
trolling it, is meant for all.

MIND-CONTROL: DIFFICULT 
BUT POSSIBLE 



In this theme, the mind and its control, we. are 
all deeply interested, in a very personal way, 
for nothing affects us individually more than 
our own minds. We know something about the 
subject. All of us try to control our minds. 
But we should like to know more and do better. 

Who can help us in this regard? Only those 
who have perfectly controlled their own minds. 
What we may learn from such sources we shall 
present here as a system of simple disciplines. 

Control of the mind is a very interesting 
inner game. If you have a sportsman's attitude 
you will thoroughly enjoy it, even while appar- 
ently losing. In the playing, this game takes a 
great deal of skill, alertness, sense of humour, 
goodness of heart, sense of strategy, patience 
and some heroic flair which makes it possible 
not to get disheartened in the face of a hundred 
failures. 






2 THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 

Sri Krsna, was explaining in the Gitd how 
the supreme state of Yoga was to be attained. 
After listening to him Arjuna said to the Lord 
in understandable despair: 

O Krsna, this yoga which you declare to be 
characterized by perfect evenness of mind, I do 
not see how it can endure, because of the rest- 
lessness of the mind. 1 The mind, O Krsna, is 
restless, turbulent, powerful and obstinate. To 
control the mind is as hard, it seems to me, as to 
control the wind.* 

Sri Krsna listened to this representative com- 
plaint of man and gave a reply important for 
all men of all times. All Indian thinking and 
practice on mind-control are largely based on 
this teaching of Sri Krsna, He said: 'Undoubt- 
edly, O Arjuna, the mind is restless and hard 
to control. But by practice (abhtjdm) and 
dispas sion (mtrdgyajlt can be controlled.* 

From this conversation we know three basic 
facts about mind-control: 

a. That it has always been an extremely 
difficult task even for heroic persons of 
the stature of Arjuna. 

b. That yet it is possible to control the mind. 

c. That there are well-defined methods for 
controlling the mind.

[IND CONTROL :* DIFFICULT BUT POSJ 

In these two words, abhyasa and vairdgya, 
practice and dispassion, Sri Krsna gave the 
whole secret of controlling the mind, 

It is the uniform verdict of all the saints of 
India dowfi the ages that there is no other way 
of controlling the mind except through 'prac- 
tice and dispassion'. This is also called 
'abhyasa-yoga' or 'the yoga of practice'. 

We shall quote here a dialogue between Sri 
Ramakrishna and a devotee, in which the former 
emphasizes a fundamental point which everyone 
needs to remember: 

Sri Ramakrishna : * Don't sit idle simply because 
your spiritual consciousness has been awakened a 
little. Go forward. Beyond the forest of sandal- 
wood there are other and more valuable things— 
silver-mines, gold-mines and so on,' 

Priya; 'Sir, our legs are in chains. We cannot 
go forward/ 

Sri Ramakrishna : f What if the legs are chained? 
The important thing is the mind. Bondage is of 
the mind, and freedom is also of the mind/ 

Priya : ' But the mind is" not under my control/ 
Sri Ramakrishna: 'How is that? There is such 
a thing as abhyasa-yoga, yoga through practice. 
Keep up the practice and you will find that your 
mind will follow in whatever direction you lead it. 
The mind like a white cloth just returned from 
the laundry. It will be red if you dip it in red 
dye and blue if you dip it in blue. It will have 
whatever colour you dip it in/* 



**M\ The Gospel of SH Ramakrishna, tr, by Swami 
Nikhilananda, Sri Ramakrishna Math, Madras, 1964 t 
p. 499. 



THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 

Practice and dispassion are no doubt the 
entire secret of controlling the mind. But how 
do we bring them into our life-stream? That 
is the question. To do this 

a. we shall have to develop a strong will to 
control the mind ; 

b. we shall have* to understand the nature 
of the mind ; 

c. we shall have to learn certain techniques 
and practise them earnestly and intelli- 
gently.

HOW TO STRENGTHEN THE WILL 
TO CONTROL THE MIND 



It cannot be said that we have no will to 

control the mind. The very fact that all of us 

have our own inner struggles indicates that we 

.liave the will. But in most cases this will to 

control the mind is not very strong. 

Our will to control the mind can never be 
strong until and unless we have deliberately 
and irrevocably renounced pleasure as one of 



HOW TO STRENGTHEN THE WILL 5 

the main pursuits of our life. The canker which 
""feats away the vitality of our will to control 
the mind is the pursuit of pleasure. It is like 
this: if you have a servant who is aware that 
you depend on him to procure you illicit drugs 
and if you both enjoy the drug together, you 
■ cannot then control that servant. The same is 
the case with the mind. The mind which we use 
for seeking pleasure and enjoying pleasure, we 
can never control until we give up seeking 
pleasure. Even after giving up the pursuit of 
pleasure it will not be easy to control it for the 
mind will always have past incidents to cite 
to embarrass us. The strength of our will to 
control the mind' will be in proportion to the 
strength and intensity of our renunciation of the 
pursuit of pleasure. Unless the pleasure-motive 
is overcome, no matter what else we do, we 
can never perfectly control the mindA The , 
derivative of this truth is that those who are ' 
reluctant to renounce the pleasure-motive are 
not sincere enough in wanting to control their 
minds, whatever their professions. 

By renunciation of the pursuit of pleasure is d 
not meant renunciation of the pursuit of joy ov/> 
bliss. By pleasure is meant the enjoyment of 
sense-pleasures or the gratification arising from 
what Sri Ramakrishna calls the 'unripe ego*, 
both of which obstruct the attainment of joy

TOE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 



or bliss, It is by going beyond pleasure and 
pain that one attains joy or bliss, which is the 
very goal of life. There is no question of giving 
up the desire for joy or bliss, for it is integral 
to us, our real nature being Existence-Know- 
ledge-Bliss. About the methods of overcoming 
the pleasure-motive something will be said in 
the next section. 

Opposites sometimes look alike. Two types 
of persons do not have inner struggle ; those 
who have become unquestioning slaves of their 
lower nature, and those who have completely 
mastered their lower nature. All others have 
inner struggles, which are the result of inade- 
quate or unsuccessful attempts at controlling 
the mind. Inadequate attempts are indications 
of weak will and of lack of knowledge as to 
how to control the mind. 

The most important thing is to strengthen 
the will to such a degree that even in the face 
of repeated failures we are not disheartened ; 
rather, that with every new failure to control 
the mind we are rousfed to fresh endeavours 
with new enthusiasm. 

\ Now how do we strengthen this will to con- 
trol the mind? We have to remove the causes 
of weakness of will. And we have to inject 
strength into it by ensuring the presence of 
suitable causes. 



HOW TO STTUSNGraEN THE WILL 

Not doubt some of us have struggled with our 
minds but have faced repeated failures. So we 
have come to believe that controlling the mind 
is not for us. Another reason for the weakness 
of our will is that most of us have perhaps not 
clearly thought what exactly is at stake in the 
control of the mind. If we had, the sheer instinct 
for survival would have driven us to strengthen 
our will to control the mind. As regards our 
failures to control the mind, we need not be 
unduly exercised. It has never been an easy 
task even for the noblest of men, the nature of 
the mind being restless. Sri Krsna says in the 
Gita : 

The turbulent senses, O Arjuna, do violently 
snatch away the mind of even a wise man, striving 
after perfection. 

For the mind which follows in the wake of the 
wandering senses, carries away his discrimination, 
as a wind carries off its course a boat on the 
waters. 6 

The Buddha teaches t 

If one man conquers in battle a thousand men 
a thousand times, and if another conquers him- 
self, he (the latter) is the greater conqueror. 6 

From this we can ( understand that controlling 
the mind is the most difficult task in the world.

THE MIND AND ITS 



tOL 



It is indeed a hero's task. Hence occasional or 
repeated failures to control the mind should not 
be taken too seriously. Failures should be taken 
as spurs to more determined, sustained, and 
intelligent efforts, for we are assured by the 
great teachers that perfect control of the mind 
is possible. All thoughts to the contrary must 
be eschewed like poison. 



WHAT IS AT STAKE IN CONTROLLING 
THE MIND 



We must clearly understand what is at stake 
in controlling the mind. Insanity is the worst 
thing that can happen to an individual as a 
result of non-control of the mind. Collectively, 
non-control of mind may lead to the downfall 
of an entire civilization, however prosperous or 
stable it may appear to be. There are many 
other lesser misfortunes that directly or indirect- 
ly issue from non-control of mind. 

Non-control of mind effectively obstructs 
integration of personality. A person of 



WHAT IS AT STAKE IN CONTROL! 



THE MIND 



uncontrolled mind will always have a tendency) 
to abnormal developments or to mental disinteg-(^v 
ration through internal conflict. Even under \ 
the most favourable circumstances he will not 
realize his potential or fulfil expectations. 

One who has no control over his mind cannot 
have peace of mind. One who has no peace 
of mind, how can he have happiness? A victim 
of passions, emotions and tensions, l he may 
develop obstinate mental maladies or turn into 
a criminal. If he is the head of a household, 
indiscipline, disorder, delinquency, and wretch- 
ed human relationships leading to family mis- 
fortunes are likely to prevail 

In an Indian maxim it is said: a man may 
have received the grace of God, of the teacher - 
and of holy men ; but if he does not have the 
grace of his own mind he will go to rack and 
ruin. Having the grace of one's own mind 
means having control of it. 

On the positive side, at its highest, through 
control of mind one can attain spiritual illumi- 
nation. Short of that there are many other 
blessings of life attainable through control of 
mind, A controlled mind can easily be con- 
centrated. Through concentration of mind one 
gains knowledge. And knowledge is power. jM 

One of the spontaneous results of control of 
mind is integration of personality. Such a person 




10 THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 

succeeds, even in adverse circumstances. A 
controlled state of mind leads to calmness, and 
calmness leads to peace of mind. Peace of mind 
leads to happiness A happy person makes 
others happy. The quality of his work im- 
proves steadily and he often attains enduring 
prosperity as a matter of course. It is not that 
such a person has not to face the trials and 
tribulations of life. But he never lacks the 
courage and strength to face them. At home, 
where he is the head, there are greater chances 
of order, discipline, joy, culture, and excellent 
human relations. Society looks upon such a 
person as an exemplar of good life, 

A person of controlled mind will be free 
from mental maladies and physical troubles 
caused by mental tension. 

In a person who has controlled his mind his 
higher nature asserts itself, and his hidden 
powers axe released. Friends wonder how this 
person could become, before their eyes, so 
great. A popular Sanskrit maxim says: 'Who 
conquers the world? He alone who conquers his 
mind/ 

Progress, prosperity or peace — nothing of an 
enduring nature can be achieved in any field, 
without control of mind. People without self-~ 
control will not retain even the prosperity that 
they have. 



HOW TO OVERCOME THE PLEAS ORE-MOTIVE 



11 



Such are the stakes in control of the mind. 
To develop a strong wiU to control the mind, 
we must teach our own minds that, without it, 
we are nowhere. We must impress upon our- 
selves the fact that the character of our entire 
future depends on whether or not we control 
our minds. After fulfilling mans basic physical 
needs, other things also may be important ; but 
for the attainment of the highest objective of 
life — spiritual illumination — nothing in life is 
more important than controlling the mind. Once 
we reklly understand and believe this, our will 
to control the mind will become strong, as 
strong as we need to have it.

HOW TO OVERCOME THE 
PLEASURE-MOTIVE 



We have said; 'Unless the pleasure-motive f 
is overcome, no matter what else we do, we 
can never perfectly control the mind; This state- 
ment may give a rude jolt to many who struggle 
with their minds. But it is a statement of fact, 



12 



THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 



and the implications of this fact need to be 
grasped. 

It is easy to say bluntly that unless the 
pleasure-motive is renounced one cannot have 
a strong will to control the mind, But the 
pleasure-urge, being elemental in us, is so deep- 
ly ingrained in our flesh and blood that it can 
be got rid of, if at all, only with the greatest 
difficulty. We must not, however, complicate 
our inner situation by imagining that we are 
wicked in seeking pleasure. The pleasure- 
motive is not in itself sinful, though, of course, 
indulgence in immoral pleasures which create 
greater bondage and retard our higher self- 
clevelopment, is, Except for a microscopic 
minority — who, in response to a higher call, 
have renounced worldly pursuits and about 
whom we are not speaking here — except for 
them, life itself will hardly be possible without 
some satisfaction of the pleasure-urge. 'What 
to live for, if not for pleasure?' will be the 
honest question of the majority of mankind. This 
urge is a living force in man, and a force by 
which he lives. , Yet it is true that the pleasure- 
motive eats away our will to control the mind. 
What then is the solution of this inner prob- 
lem? 

To be sure, ascetic denial is not the answer 
for the vast majority. Neither is the answer 






HOW TO OVERCOME THE PLEASURE-MOTIVE 



18 



indulgence. The answer is in gradually educat- 
ing our pleasure-urge, and in understanding the 
dimensions of our own being and how to 
harness the pleasure-urge for the purpose of 
self-fulfilment. This will need some elabora- 
tion. 

Incidentally it is as well to make it clear that 
we are now discussing a general problem that 
faces beginners who are worldly in their dis- 
positions. For those who are advanced aspir- 
ants some of the points we are going to dis- 
cuss will not hold good. They will know what 
these points are ; for example, the enjoyment of 
legitimate sense-pleasure is permissible for the 
ordinary person who has yet to make a start in 
spiritual life, but not for the person who has 
taken several steps in it. 

' Don't seek pleasure ' is hardly a practical pre- 
cept for any One who has a pronounced craving 
for pleasure in his nature. The illumined 
teachers of India, besides being knowers of 
truth, were masters of human psychology and 
compassionate preceptors. What they taught on 
this subject can be put in a few words: seek 
pleasure, but in a way which will not spoil your 
physical or mental health, or obstruct your 
higher development If you must seek physi- 
cal pleasure, seek them in such a way that your 
powers may be preserved for enjoying the joys 



14 



[E MIND AND ITS CONTOOL 




of the mind ; seek the joys of the mind in such 
a way that your powers may be preserved for 
attaining the bliss of the spirit. Do not seek 
pleasure in a way that will destroy you. This 
should make sense to thinking people. Ethical 
principles, the observance of which is helpful in 
controlling the mind, are all meant to protect 
a man from harming himself. Thus they serve 
his profoundest interest. 

The wild pleasure-urge has first to be domes- 
ticated in the frame of the requirements of self- 
development before it can be ready for gradua- 
tion. What do we mean by ' graduation * here? 
Sri Ramakrishna teaches: 

...There are three kinds of ananda, joy: 
the joy of worldly enjoyment (vistiyananda), the 
joy of worship (bhajanananda) and the joy of 
Brahman (Brahmananda). The joy of worldly 
enjoyment is the joy of sense-objects which people 
always enjoy. The joy of worship one enjoys while 
chanting the name and glories of God. And the 
joy of Brahman is the joy of God-vision. After 
experiencing the joy of God-vision the r$is of 
olden times went beyond all rules and con- 
ventions, 7 

By graduation we mean passing from one of 
the above kinds or levels of joy to one above. 
We must remember that the joy of Brahman 
is attainable by man not only theoretically but 

T 'M\ op. cit, p. 404, 






HOW TO OVERCOME THE PLEASURE-MOTIVE^ 15 

actually. A firm faith in this truth is necessary 
for graduation in pleasure-seeking. 

Seek sense-pleasure (visaydnanda), if you 
must, then, but in a way which does not run 
counter to gaining the joy of worship (bhaja- 
ndnanda). This can be done through develop- 
ing the habit of discrimination and being dis- 
criminating in the sense-pleasures you seek. 
Sri Krsna teaches in the Gita? and experience* 
corroborates, that all contact-born happiness is 
productive of misery. To remember this even , \ 
while enjoying sense-pleasures will develop the 
habit of discrimination. Then it will be easier 
for a person to seek sense-pleasure within the 
frame of moral disciplines, which is meant to 
preserve him for enjoying the highest bliss, 
Along with this he should engage in suitable 
forms of spiritual discipline which are con- 
ducive to the joy of worship (bhajanananda). 
Gradually, as his mind gets more and more, 
purified, his interest in sense-enjoyment will be 
less and less, and his, interest in the joy of 
worship will increase proportionately, 

A time will eventually come in the life of 
the person who sincerely struggles on in this 
way, when he faces the necessity of setting 
aside even the joy of worship, and becoming 
a firm seeker of the Supreme Spirit, It is one

thing to seek the benefits of seeking God and 
quite a different thing to seek God for His own 
sake, benefit or no benefit. When the seeker has 
inwardly grown to* the extent of seeking the 
Supreme Spirit for its own sake and for no 
other motive, then his desire for pleasure will 
have been sublimated, and this will be con- 
ducive to perfect contrql of the mind. Sri 
Ramakrishna teaches: 

When does the attraction of sense-pleasure die 
away? When one realizes the consummation of 
all happiness and all pleasures in God— -the in- 
divisible eternal ocean of bliss. Those who enjoy 
Him can find no attraction in the cheap worthless 
pleasures of the world. 

He who has once tasted the refined crystal of 
sugar-candy finds no pleasure in tasting dirty 
treacle. He who has slept in a palace will not 
find pleasure in lying down in a hovel. The soul 
that has tasted the sweetness of divine bliss finds 
no happiness in the vulgar pleasures of the world, 5 * 

Many well-meaning but misdirected aspirants 
struggle with their desire for pleasure in a 
wrong way. In their earnestness they do not 
hesitate even to do harm to themselves, but it 
is all in vain. Ultimately they are vanquished, 
notwithstanding their honesty of purpose and 
sincerity. So it is very important to avoid this 
pitfall in handling the problem of our inner 

6 Sayings of Sri Ramakrishna, Sri Ramakrishna Math, 
Madras, 1960, sayings 244, 245. 









HOW TO OVERCOME THE PLEASURE-MOTIVE 



17 



life — the desire for pleasure. Sri Ramakrishna 
teaches a helpful way, On being asked/ when 
the enemies of man, such as lust, anger, etc. 
would be vanquished, the Master replied: 

So long as these passions are directed towards 
the world and its objects, the^ behave like ene- 
mies. But when they are directed towards God, 
they become the best friends of man, for they 
lead him to God, Lust for the things of the 
world must be changed into hankering for God ; 
the anger that a man feels towards his fellow -men 
should be turned towards God for not revealing 
Himself, One should deal with all the passions 
in the same manner. These passions cannot be 
eradicated but can be educated. 10 

What Sri Ramakrishna appears to mean by 
'passions cannot be eradicated but can be 
educated* is that the passions cannot be de- 
stroyed but can be harnessed and purified. If we 
direct our passions to lower things we remain on 
a lower level ; by linking them to higher objec- 
tives we rise higher. If we link them to the 
Supreme Spirit, by their driving force we rise to 
IIim J and they, on the oilier hand, are educated 
and purified and cease to be passions in the 
ordinary sense. After a person has experientially 
known that he is the Atman and not the body- 
mind complex, passions cease, for passion is 
simply desire wrongly oriented, tn other words 
desire can be a friend or a foe" according to the 

10 Ibid,, saying 426. 



18 



THE MIND AND ITS CONTBOL 



direction we give it. When desire is directed 
towards reality it becomes the instrument of 
liberation and joy; when it is directed towards 
the unreal it becomes the instrument of bond- 
age and misery. 

Vedanta traces the pleasure-motive in man to 
his metaphysical root, ananda or bliss, the ulti- 
mate fact' of existence from which man is essen- 
tially non-different. The Upanisad teaches: 

That which is known as the self-creator is 
verily the source of joy; for one becomes happy 
by coming in contact with that source of joy. 
Who, indeed, will inhale, and who will exhale, if 
this Bliss be not there in the supreme space 
(within the heart). This one, indeed, enlivens 
(people). 11 

Certainly all beings here are, indeed, born from 
Bliss (ananda) ; having been born they remain alive 
by Bliss ; and on departing they enter into Bliss. 12 

The very root of man's existence being bliss, 
it is but natural that he should instinctively 
seek to feel identified with it. But when he is 
ignorant and is identified with body and mind, 
he seeks it ignorantly in the body and mind 
and not where it is— in the Spirit. This wrong 
seeking of bliss in a wrong place gives rise to 
^ our pleasure-motive and its resultant bondage. 
As we have said before, bliss (ananda) is \ 
not pleasure, it is beyond pleasure and pain, y* 

11 Taittiriya Upantfad, II, 7, 

12 Ibid., III. 6.

which can never be separated on the physical / p 
and mental plane. 

It is man's essential nature that urges him to 
seek bliss. And after much striving and fitful 
seeking of it on the material and mental planes, 
in the limited, man ultimately discovers it within 
his very Self— the Atman, which is unlimited, 
being identical with the Supreme Spirit. 

He then realizes the truth of this teaching 
of the Upanisad r 'In the Infinite alone is bliss • 
there is no bliss in the finite/ 13 To come to 
know this fact man must learn at one stage 
that bliss is different from pleasure and pain 
and that to attain it he must control his mind 
and give his pleasure-motive a higher direction.

THE NATURE OF THE MIND: 
HINDU VIEW 



The will to control the mind is not enough. 
We need also to know something about the 
nature of the mind. This we shall briefly discuss 

^Chdndogya Upanifad, VII. 23. 1. 



20 THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 

in the light of Hindu psychology, which 
has long had an adequate system of disciplines 
for controlling the mind, Hindu psychology is 
considered to be a science because it has 
through proper investigation and verification 
devised methods for the absolute control of the 
mind, leading to the attainment of perfection or 
illumination. What we say here is mostly 
derived from Hindu psychology as it is inter- 
preted by Swami Vivekananda in his Complete 
Works. 

Mind is a finer body within this gross body. 
The physical body is, as it were, only the outer 
crust of the mind. The mind being the finer 
part of the body, the one affects the other. It 
is for this reason that physical illness often affects 
the mind and mental illness or tension often 
affects the body. 

Behind the mind is the Atman, the real Self 
of man, Body and mind are material ; Atman 
is pure Spirit Mind is not the Atman but dis- 
tinct from the Atman. 

To use an analogy from science, the differ- 
ence between matter and mind is only in the 
rate of vibration, Mind at a low rate of vibra- 
tion is called matter: matter at a high rate of 
vibration is known as mind. Both matter and 
mind are governed by the same laws of time, 
space and causation. 



THE NATURE OF THE M1TND : HINDU VIEW

Matter is convertible into mind, though we 
may not have realized that this is so. Take 
for instance a person who does not eat for two 
weeks. What happens to him ? Not only does 
his body become emaciated, his mind also 
becomes blank. If he fasts for a few days more 
he cannot even think. He does not even re- 
member his name. When he begins to take 
food, again, strength slowly returns to his body 
and his memory revives. Therefore it must be 
that food, which is matter, becomes mind. 

We read in the Upanisad of Uddalaka teach- 
ing his son Svetaketu by experiment how food 
is converted into mind. The two chapters with 
other relevant teachings run thus; 

f That, my dear, which is the subtlest part of 
curds rises, when they are churned, and becomes 
butter. In the same manner, my dear, that which 
is the subtlest part of the food that is eaten rises 
and becomes mind. The subtlest part of water 
that is drunk rises and becomes prana. Thus, 
my dear, the mind consists of food, prana consists 
of water, and speech consists of fire/ 

The son Svetaketu said: 'Please, venerable sir, 
instruct me further.' 

'So be it, my dear. A person, my dear, consists 
of sixteen parts. Do not eat (any food) for fifteen 
days, but drink as much water as you like. Since 
the prana consists of water, it will not be cut off 
if you drink water.' 

Svetaketu did not eat (any food) for fifteen days. 
Then he came to his father and said: 'What* 
sir, shall I recite ?* 







THE MIND 



lOL 



His father said: 'The Rk, Yajus and Saman 
verses.' 

He replied: 'They do not occur to me, sir,' 
(He could not remember the Vedas,) 

His father said to him: *Just as, my dear, of a 
great blazing fire a single coal, the size of a .fire- 
fly, may be left, which would not burn much 
more than that, even so, my dear, of your sixteen 
parts only one part is left; and therefore with 
that one part you do not remember the Vedas. 
Now go and eat and you will understand me.' 

Svetaketu ate and approached his father. Then 
whatever his father asked him, he showed that 
he knew it. 

Then his father said to him: 'Just as, my dear, 
of a great lighted fire a single coal of the size 
of a firefly, if left, may be made to blaze up 
again by adding grass to it, and will thus burn 
much more, even so, my dear, of your sixteen 
parts only one paTt was left, and that, when 
strengthened by food, blazed up. With it you 
now remember the Vedas. Therefore, my dear, 
the mind consists of food, the praya consists of 
water, and speech consists of Are.' 

After that he understood what his father said ; 
yes, he understood it 1 * 

Those who doubt this teaching are invited to 
fast for fifteen days living only on water and 
see what happens to their mindl 

Essentially man is not the mind but the Self 
or Atman. The Atman is ever free, infinite and 
eternal It is pure consciousness. In man the 
free agent is not the mind but the Self. Mind 
is, as it we re, an instrument in the Self s hands, 

14 Ibid., VI. 5. 5-0, 



the na:

) 



through which the Self apprehends and 
responds to the external world. 

This instrument with which the Self comes 
in contact with the external world is itself 
constantly changing and vacillating. When the 
vacillating instrument is made motionless, it can 
reflect the Atman. 

Though the mind is not a free agent, its 
powers are simply incalculable. If man has 
smashed the invisible atom and released its 
power, if man has realized the unseen Atman 
and become illumined, it is through the powers 
of the mind that he had done these tilings ; and 
so with all his other achievements in the diverse 
fields which fall between these two poles of 
attainment. In fact the mind is omnipresent. 
Each mind is a part of the universal mind. 
Each mind is connected with every other mind. 
Therefore each mind, wherever it may be, can 
be in communication with the whole world. 

The Upantsad teaches: 'He shining all these 
shine. Through His radiance all these become 
manifest in various ways.* 15 This profound 
teaching is to be remembered in order to under- 
stand the Hindu view of the mind. The source 
of all light is Brahman, the Supreme Spirit, pure 
consciousness. What is known as Atman, the 
knowing Self of the living being, is identical 




w Kafka, II.2.15. 



24 THE MIND AND ITS CONTBOL 

with Brahman, pure consciousness. It is the 
radiance of this pure consciousness which mani- 
fests all things at all times. 

The mind, composed pf subtle matter, trans- 
parent and closest to the Self, is the inner instru- 
ment (antahkarana) of this knowing Self. .It is 
not the source of light. There is no conscious- 
ness inherent in the mind. The mind receives 
the radiance of consciousness ■ from the know- 
ing Self, whose inner instrument it is, and illu- 
minates all things including physical light. 
Though having no light of its own the mind 
appears to be luminous. Though it seems to 
cognize, the mind is not the cognizer, but only 
an instrument of cognition. Shining as it does 
with the borrowed light of consciousness, the 
mind is an effective instrument of knowledge. 

From our own experience we can know in a 
number of ways that there is a mind distinct 
from the organs and the body. We can think, 
feel, will, imagine, remember, rejoice, regret 
without using any of our ten organs, which 
proves that there is a distinct inner instrument 
making aH these functions possible. 

In order to convince those who doubt 
whether the mind is a distinct inner instrument 
the Upanisad gives the following argument: 

They say, *I was absent-minded, I did not see 
it*; *I was absent-minded, I did not hear it/ It 
is through the mind that one sees and hears. 



THE NATURE OF THE MIND : HINDU VIEW 



/ 




Desire, resolve, doubt, faith, want of faith, steadi- 
ness, unsteadiness, shame, intelligence and fear 

all these are but the mind. Even if one is touched 
from behind, one knows it through the mind * 
therefore (the mind exists). 16 

The mind has the power of looking back into 
itself. With the help of the mind we can ana- 
lyse the mind, and see what is going on in 
the mind. 

According to the Hindu analysis the mind 
has three constituents, three levels, four func- 
tions, and five conditions, which we shall explain 
very briefly. 

Why is it that the mind is not always found 
in a uniform state? The reason is that the 
mind is compound of three substantive forces 
called gunas, viz sattva, rajas and tamos. These 
gunas are also the basic constituents of the 
entire universe, physical and mental. Sattva 
is the principle of poise conducive to purity, 
knowledge and joy. Rajas is the principle of 
motivity, leading to activity, desire, and rest- 
lessness. Tamos is the principle of inertia re- 
sulting in inaction, dullness and delusion. Tamos 
causes the mind to move on a low level ; rajas 
scatters the mind and makes it restless and 
sattva gives it a higher direction. 

It is not easy to define the gunas. Hence 




16 



Brhadara^yaka Upani$ad t 1.5,3. 



26 



THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 



Vidyaranya defines them according to their 
effects : 

Non-attachment, forgiveness, generosity, etc. are 
products of sattw* Desire, anger, avarice, etc., are 
products of rajas. Lethargy, confusion, drowsiness, 
etc. are products of tamos. When sattva functions 
in the mind, merit is acquired; when rajas func- 
tions, demerit is produced. When tamos functions, 
neither merit nor demerit is produced, but life is 
wasted for nothing. 17 

The constitution of individual minds is deter- 
mined by the various combinations and permu- 
tations of these gunas. This explains the varie- 
ties in human nature and also the vacillating 
nature of the mind. 

We often say: T have changed my mind/ 
This would be impossible if the mind were com- 
posed of one substantive force only. In that 
case men could neither fall nor rise. All would 
then remain as they were born. 

We are familiar with the words, conscious 
and subconscious. These indicate different 
planes on which the r mind operates. On the 
conscious plane all work is normally accom- 
panied by the feeling of egoism. On the sub- 
conscious plane the feeling of egoism is absent. 
There is a still higher plane on which the 
mind can work. It ean go beyond relative 
consciousness. Just as the subconscious is 
beneath consciousness, so there is another plane 






" Fancadahl, II. 14-16. 




THE NATURE OF THE MIND : HINDU VIEW 



27* 



which is above relative consciousness. This is 
called the superconscious plane. Here also the 
feeling of egoism is absent, but there is a vast 
difference between this and the subconscious 
plane, When the mind passes beyond the plane 
of relative consciousness it enters into samddhi 
or superconsciousness, 

The superconscious plane of the mind is the 
mind in its pure state. In a sense it is then 
identical with Atman. This is why Sri Rama- 
krishna says: That which is pure mind is also 
pure buddhi; that again is pure Atman.* 18 

These three planes of conscious, subconscious 
and superconspious all belong to the same mind. 
There are not three minds in one man but three 
levels on which the mind operates. 

The question of controlling the mind relates 
only to the conscious plane, where the mind is 
normally accompanied by the feeling of 
egoism. We cannot directly control the sub- 
conscious mind unless we are established in 
Yoga, The question of controlling the mind 
on the superconscious plane does not arise. But 
the superconscious plane can be reached only 
by those who have controlled their minds on 
the conscious and subconscious planes. 

The mind in its functional aspect has four

faculties, viz manas, buddhiy ahamkara and 
citta, Manas is that modification of the internal 
instrument (antahkarana) which considers the 
pros and cons of a subject. Buddhi is that 
modification of the internal instrument which 
determines. Citta is that modification of the 
inner instrument which remembers. Ahamkara 
is that modification of the inner instrument 
which is characterized by self-consciousness. In 
every external perception these four functions 
of the mind are involved. These four functions 
follow one another so rapidly that they seem 
instantaneous. 

The mind manifests itself in the following 
five conditions: 'scattering, darkening, gather- 
ing, one-pointed and concentrated/ As Swami 
Vivekananda explains; 

The scattering form is activity. Its tendency is 
to manifest in the form of pleasure or of pain. The 
darkening form is dullness which tends to injury.... 
The commentator says, the third form is natural to 
deoas and angels, and the first and second to the 
demons. The gathering form is when it struggles 
to centre itself. The one-pointed form is when it 
tries to concentrate, and the concentrated form 
is what brings us to samadhi. 1 * 

The ordinary conditions of the mind are 
'darkened* and "scattered*. In the darkened state 
a man feels dull and passive. In the scattered

state he feels restless. Through practising the 
disciplines of yoga the same mind can be 
'gathered* and made 'one-pointed*. The whole 
purpose of mind-control is to make the mind 
one-pointed. When such a mind is applied 
to any sphere of activity, in that it shines. 
A businessman with a one-pointed mind will 
prosper in business ; a musician with a one- 
pointed mind will become a great musician; a 
scientist with a one-pointed mind will become 
a celebrated scientist. Through the practice and 
devlopment of one-pointedness, the mind 
reaches the fifth or highest condition, called 
concentrated*. In this condition superconscions- 
ness is attained.

HOW NOT TO MAKE MIND-CONTROL 
UNNECESSARILY DIFFICULT 



We have said something about the nature of 
the mind as understood in Hinduism. While 
this knowledge may be helpful, it will not neces- 
sarily lead to control of the mind. Much 




30 N THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 

knowledge about human psychology can very 
well go with marked non-control of the mind. 
The main thing is to have a strong will to 
control the mind. If we have that, knowledge 
of psychology will certainly help, provided we 
steadily practise the prescribed disciplines. 

By certain actions, dispositions, and habits of 
thought we make our task of controlling the mind 
almost impossible. It will be helpful to know 
what these are, so that we may avoid them. 

If we have strong likes and dislikes, attach- 
ments and aversions, we shall not be able to 
control our minds. 

If we live an immoral life we shall not be 
able to control our minds. 

If we have the habit of deliberately harming 
others we shall not be able to control our minds. 

If we indulge in intoxicants, live unbalanced 
and chaotic lives, e.g. eat, drink, talk, work, 
or sleep too little or too much, we shall not be 
able to control our minds. 

If we habitually indulge in vain controversy, 
are inordinately inquisitive about others' affairs, 
or are too anxious to find others' faults, we shall 
not be able to control our minds. 

If we torture our bodies unnecessarily, spend 
our energies in futile pursuits, force rigid silence 
upon ourselves, or become too egocentric, we 
shall not easily control our minds. 






HOW NOT TO MAKE MIND- CONTROL DIFFICULT 31 

If we are over-ambitious irrespective of our 
capacities, if we are jealous of others* prosperity, 
or if we are self-righteous, we shall not easily 
control our minds. 

If we have a feeling of guilt, we shall not 
be able to control our minds. Therefore we 
must erase all guilt from within us. To repent 
for "sins committed and ask God's help for 
strength of will so that they may not be re- 
peated, that is all that is needed to be free 
from guilt. 

To succeed in controlling the mind one must 
have, in addition to a strong will, faith in one- 
self. Sri Krsna says in the Gitc^ that one must 
oneself subdue one's weakness and raise one- 
self by .oneself. This teaching must be prac- 
tised by one who intends to control his mind. 

The mind will have to be controlled by the 
mind itself. The difficulties which we experience 
in controlling the mind are created by our own 
mind. Mind cannot be controlled by artificial 
means for any length of time. Deliberate, 
patient, intelligent, systematic hard work accord- 
ing to tested and suitable disciplines is needed. 






20 VI. 5. 



A CLEAR GRASP OF THE TASK 
ON HAND NEEDED 



It must be clearly understood and fully 
accepted that there is no gimmick by which the 
mind can be controlled. Those who are in a 
hurry and looking for clever, devices may well 
be warned that the mind, a delicate instrument, 
should be handled very carefully. The entire, 
work of controlling the mind will have to be 
done by ourselves. No one else can do it for 
us. We cannot get it done by someone else for 
a fee. It is our personal task. We must do it 
ourselves. And we shall need great patience to 
do it Swami Vivekananda teaches: 

The mind has to be gradually and systematically 
brought under control. The will has to be strength- 
ened by slow, continuous, and persevering drill 
This is no child's play, no fad to be tried one day 
and discarded the next. It is a life's work ; and the 
end to be attained is well worth all that it can 
cost us to reach it; being nothing less than the 
realization of our absolute oneness with the Divine. 
Surely, with this end in view, and with the know- 
ledge that we can certainly succeed, no price can 
be too great to pay. 21

A FAVOURABLE INNER CLIMATE 
NEEDS TO RE CREATED 



To be able to practise the disciplines leading 
to the control of the mind we need to create 
a favourable inner climate by consciously ac- 
cepting certain inevitables of life. Though they 
are inevitable, often enough we do not accept 
them as such with the result that unnecessary 
mental problems are created. But those who 
want to control their minds must scrupulously 
avoid loading the mind with unnecessary prob- 
lems, for there are quite enough of necessary 
and unavoidable ones. We shall all do well ta 
practise these teachings of the Buddha in the 
An guttata TSIikdya: 

Bhikkhus, these five things must be contem- 
plated by all men and women, householders as well 
as bhikkhus. 

1. Old age will come upon me some day and 
I cannot avoid it, 

2. Disease can come upon me some day and I 
cannot avoid it. 

3. Death will come upon me some day and I 
cannot avoid it. 

4. All things that I hold dear are subject to 
change and decay and separation* and I ca mot 
avoid it. 









34 THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 

5. I am the outcome of my own deeds and what- 
ever be my deeds, good or bad, I shall be 
heir to them, 

Bhikkhus, by contemplating old age the pride 
of youth can be curbed, or at least reduced; by 
contemplating disease the pride of health can be 
curbed, or at least reduced ; by contemplating death 
the pride of life is curbed, or at least reduced ; 
by contemplating the change and separation of all 
things dear, the passionate desire for possession 
is curbed, or at least reduced ; and by contem- 
plating that one is the result of one's own deeds, 
the evil propensities of thought, word and deed 
are* curbed, or at least reduced. 

One who contemplates these five things can 
curb, or at least reduce, his pride and passion and 
thus be able to tread the path of Nirvana, 22 

The practice of these teachings of the Buddha 
will indirectly help purification of the mind*

TWO SETS OF INNER DISCIPLINES 

To control the mind we have to develop for 
ourselves two sets of inner disciplines: 
a. One set is for permanent basic operation. 

^Sudhakar Dikshit, Sermons and Sayings of the 
Buddha, Chetana, Bombay, pp. 49-50. 



TWO SETS OF INNER DISCIPLINES 



35 



b. The other set is for providing high-power 
emergency brakes. 

The first set will give a general healthy direc- 
tion to the mind. The second will save us in 
emergencies. 

. If the first set is not practised, we cannot 
make use of the second set at all, for the simple 
reason that the power-supply for the second 
system comes from the first set of disciplines 
when these are effectively practised. 

In the first set several basic disciplines are 
included : 

1. Life must be held in a proper frame of 
constructive thinking. There should be a routine 
for daily life and certain basic principles by 
which a sense of direction is given to whatever 
we do. There should also be certain moral com- 
mitments by which conduct, should be guided. 

Those who have no moral and other prin- 
ciples, and no regularity of life, will find it 
almost impossible to control the mind. We have 
to bring rhythm into our life in order to control 
the mind. 

2. To control the mind we must check its pro- 
verbial restlessness. In Raja-Yoga Swami Vive- 
kananda describes the restlessness of the mind: 

How hard it is to control the mind! Well has 
it been compared to the maddened monkey. There 
was a monkey, restless by his own nature, as all 
monkeys are. As if that were not enough some 









36 THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 

one made him drink freely of wine, so that the 
became still more restless. Then a scorpion stung 
him. When a man is stung by a scorpion he 
jumps about for a whole day ; so the poor monkey 
found his condition worse than ever. To complete 
his misery a demon entered into him. What 
language can describe the uncontrollable restless- 
ness of that monkey? The human mind is like that 
monkey, incessantly active by its own nature ; then 
it becomes drunk with the wine of desire, thus 
increasing its turbulence. After desire takes pos- 
session comes the sting of the scorpion of jealousy 
of the success of others, and last of all the demon 
of pride enters the mind, making it think itself of 
all importance. How hard to control such a mind! 23 

To check its restlessness we must know the 
causes. What are these causes? The causes of 
restlessness are the impurities of the mind, 



10 



THE PURER THE MIND THE EASIER 
TO CONTROL 



Swami Vivekananda teaches: 

The purer the mind, the easier it is to control. 
Purity of the mind must be insisted upon if you 



'# 



Op. Cit, Vol. I, 1962, p. 174. 



THE PURER THE MIND THE EASIER TO CONTROL 

would control it Perfect morality is the all in 

all of complete control over mind. The man who 
is perfectly moral has nothing more to do ; he is 
free. 21 

The control of the mind depends on its purity. 
We are unable to control our mind because at 
present it is impure. If we live in a way which 
makes the mind more impure, and at the same 
time make assiduous efforts to control the mind, 
this will be futile. Again, if without doing any- 
thing regarding purification of the mind, we 
just go ahead to control our mind, we are not 
likely to succeed, except in the rare case when 
we start with a highly pure mind. What we 
need is a system of discipline for controlling 
the mind which will also obliterate its impuri- 
ties. 

What are these impurities of the mind? They 
are the urges, impulses and emotions like envy, 
hatred, anger, fear, jealousy, lust, greed, con- 
ceit, temptation, etc. born of the two lower 
gunas, rajas and tamas. These impurities cause 
disturbance in the mind by creating attachment 
and aversion, and thus rob it of tranquillity. 

How do we remove these impurities? 



« Ibid., Vol, VI, 1963, p. 126. 



11 

CHANGING THE CONSTITUTION 
OF THE MIND 




The impurities of the mind can be gradually 
removed by providing the mind with whole- 
some food, and by bringing about a change in 
the constitution of the mind so that sattva pre- 
dominates over the other two gunas. Finally, 
it is true, sattva has to be transcended ; but first 
it has to predominate. 

We mentioned earlier that according to the 
teachings of the Upanisad the mind consists of 
food. 25 In elaborating this teaching the Upani- 
sad says: 

The food that we eat is transformed in three 
different ways: the grossest part of it becomes 
excrement, the middle part is transformed into 
flesh, and the subtlest part goes to form the mind. 2 * 

Further : 

Just as in the churning of curds, the subtlest 
part rises up and is transformed into butter, so 
when food is eaten, the subtlest part rises up and 
is transformed into mind. 37 



^Chdndogya Upanisad, VI. 5.4. 
*Ibid., VI. 5.1. 
*Ibid., VI. 6.1-2. 



CHANGING THE CONSTf/TUTTON OF THE MIND 



39 



As the mind consists of food, naturally the 
teaching follows: 

s 

When the food is pure, the mind becomes pure. 
When the mind becomes pure, memory becomes 
firm. And when a man is in possession of firm 
memory, all the bonds which tie him down to the 
world are loosed, 28 

According to the commentary of Sankaracarya 
the word *food* in the text means anything that 
is taken in by the senses, that is to say, sounds, 
sights, smells, etc. And 'the mind becomes 
pure' means that it becomes free from aversion, 
attachment or delusion, which create disquiet 
in the mind, making it difficult to control. So 
one of the basic methods of controlling the 
mind is to desist from taking such 'food* as 
.will cause attachment, aversion and delusion. 

But how do we know which food will cause 
attachment, aversion and delusion? Broadly 
speaking, according to the Gtta, rajasika and 
tamiisika food cause attachment, aversion and 
1 delusion. Sdttvika food helps a person to re- 
duce attachment, aversion and delusion. It is 
not only what is usually taken through the 
mouth for nourishment which will have some 1 
thing to do with the state of the mind. Liquor 
and drugs are also taken through the mouth, 
and they also affect the mind. We can easily 

28 Ibid, VII. 26. 2. 



THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 

see the difference in effect when we drink a 
glass of sugar-candy water and a glass of liquor. 
The effect of drugs on the state of the mind 
is well known. Also, as we have noted, what 
we see with our eyes, hear with our ears, and 
what we touch, have great effect on our minds. 
A movie, or an oration, can set in motion waves 
of various sorts in the mind, making it difficult 
or easy to control. 

So, in moulding the conditions favourable for 
controlling the mind, judicious eating and drink- 
ing are of some help. Equally important is the 
intake through the other senses. In the choice 
of food, persons desiring to control the mind 
will do well to prefer sattvika to rdjaMka and 
tamasika foods. So far as food taken through 
the mouth is concerned, the Gitd is our best 
guide : 

The foods which augment vitality, energy, 
strength, health, cheerfulness and appetite, which 
are savoury and oleaginous, substantial and agree- 
able, are liked by the sattvika. 

The foods that are bitter, sour, saline, excessively 
hot, pungent, dry and burning are liked by the 
rajasika and are productive of pain, grief and 
disease. 

That which is stale and tasteless, stinking, cook- 
ed overnight, refuse and impure is the food liked 
by the tamasikaP 

What is liked by sdttvika, rajasika and 



29 XVII. 8-10, 



CHANGING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE MIND 41 

tdmasika persons is also conducive to develop- 
ing sdUvika, rdjasika and tdmasika minds 
respectively. 

Human nature being constituted by varying 
combinations of the three substantive forces, 
sattva, rajas and tamos, the predominance of 
one of the three gunas over the other two deter- 
mines the dominant tone of a man's nature, A 
man with a preponderance of rajas or tamos in 
his nature cannot behave, in spite of himself, 
like a man with a preponderance of sattva. 
This is why Sri Krsna says in- despair, as it 
were, in the Gita: 'Even a wise man acts in 
accordance with his own nature: beings follow 
nature: what can restraint do?' 30 

If restraint can do nothing, if human nature 
is predetermined and incapable of being chang- 
ed, then there is little sense in discussing how 
to control the mind. The implication of this 
statement of the Lord, therefore, seems to be: 
man must change his nature, physical and men- 
tal, in order to be able to control the mind. So 
long as rajas or tamas predominates in the con- 
stitution of our mind, we cannot control it, how- 
ever much we may try. The reason for this 
should be understood. According to the teach- 
ings of Vedanta: 

Rajas has its vityepa-sakU or projecting power, 
80 Ibid, HI. 33.

THE MIND AND ITS CONTR( 




which is of the nature of an activity, and from 
which this primeval flow of activity has emanated. 
From this also, mental modifications such as attach- 
ment and grief are continually produced. 

Lust, anger, avarice, arrogance, spite, egoism, 
envy, jealousy etc. — these are the dire attributes 
of rajas, from which the worldly tendency of man 
is produced. Therefore rajas is a cause of bondage. 

Avrti or the veiling power is the power of tamas, 
which makes things appear other than what they 
are. It is this that causes man's repeated trans- 
migrations, and starts the action of the projecting 
power. 

Absence of right judgement, or contrary judge- 
ment, want of definite belief and doubt — these cer- 
tainly never desert one who has any connection 
with this veiling power, and then the projecting 
power gives ceaseless trouble. 31 

The psychological consequences of the 
predominance of the projecting power of rajas 
and the veiling power of tamas make control- 
ling the mind in which these powers are 
dominant a difficult task. Yet there is another 
constituent of the mind which makes the task 
not a hopeless one. This constituent is saliva, 
which is found in a mixed or pure state. On 
this, Vedanta teaches: 

Pure sattva is (clear) like water, yet in con- 
junction with rajas and tamas, it makes for transmi- 
gration. The reality of Atman becomes reflected 




31 Sri Sankaracarya, Vicekacudamani, tr. by Swami 
Madhavananda, Advaita Ashrama, Calcutta, verses 
111-13, 115. 






CHANGING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE MIND 




in sattva, and like the sun reveals the entire 
world of matter. The traits of mixed saliva are 
an utter absence of pride etc., niyama, yama, etc., 
as well as faith, devotion, yearning for liberation, 
the divine tendencies, and turning away from the 
unreal. 

The traits of pure sattva are cheerfulness, the 
realization of one's own Self, supreme peace, con- 
tentment, Jbliss, and steady devotion to Atman by 
which the aspirant enjoys bliss everlasting. 33 

So we find — and it is very important to 
understand this — that built into our own 
nature are powerful impediments and potent 
help in controlling the mind. It is therefore a 
question of devising the right strategy so that 
the inimical forces may be defeated and the 
helpful forces given full play. This can be done 
not by engaging in a blind mad fight, but by 
skilfully operating the inner forces. 

The strategic question in regard to the 
control of mind is this : can we so change the "f 
gwntf-balance in our nature as to bring about 
the preponderance of sattva? Teachings on thisi 
problem are therefore of great help to us. In 
the Sfimad Bhagavatam we find: 

The gunas, sattva, rajas and .tamas, belong to 
the intellect and not to the Self. Through sattva 
one should subdue the other two and subdue 
sattva also by means of sattva itself. 

Through developed sattva a man attains that form 
of spirituality which consists in devotion to Me. 



32 Ibid., 117*19.- 



44 



THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 






Through the use of sattvika things (i.e. 
tend to purity and illumination and so 
is developed ; this leads to spirituality. 

That superior form of spirituality which 
on by an increase of sattva destroys 
tamas. And when both of them . are 
iniquity which has its rise in them, is al 
destroyed. 83 



those that 
on) sattva 

is brought 
rajas and 
destroyed, 
so quickly 



In the teaching that through developed 
sattva the aspirant attains spirituality we get 
the most important lesson for our purpose, for 
attainment of spirituality and mind-control are 
identical in one sense. So, of utmost importance 
for those who want to control the mind is to 
know how to develop sattva. 

What are the sattvika things and activities by 
means of which sattva can be made to pre- 
dominate? Sri Krsna specifies them in the next 
verse : 

Scriptures, water, people, place, time, work, birth, 
meditation, mantra and purification — these are the 
ten causes which develop the gunas. 3 * 

The import of this verse is that 'each of these 
has its sattvika, rajasika and tamasika counter- 
parts j the first conducing to purity, illumina- 
tion, and bliss ; the second to temporary 
pleasure followed by painful reaction ; and the 
.last leading to ignorance and increasing 
bondage. The teaching continues: 



33 Book XI, chapter 13, verses 1-3. 

34 Ibid., verse 4. 




CHANGING THE CONSTTTUTION OF THE MIND 



Of these, those alone are sattvika, which the sages 
praise ; the tamasa are what they condemn ; while 
those are rajasa about which they are indifferent. 

For the increase of saliva a man should con- 
cern himself with sattvika things alone. Thence 
comes spirituality, and from this again knowledge, 
leading to the realization of one's independence 
and the .removal of the superimposition of gross 
and subtle bodies, 35 

The import of the last verse is: 

Only those scriptures are to be followed which 
teach nivrtti or the march back to the oneness of 
Brahman, not those that teach pravrtti or contin- 
uing the multiplicity (rajasika) or those that teach 
downright injurious tenets (tamasika). Similarly 
holy water only is to be used, not scented water 
or wine, etc. ; one should mix only with spiritual 
people, not with wordly-minded or wicked people. 
A solitary place is to be preferred, not a public 
thoroughfare or a gaming-house. Early morning 
or some such time is to be selected for meditation 
in preference to hours likely to cause distraction 
or dullness. Obligatory and unselfish works alone 
should be done, not selfish or harmful ones. Initia- 
tion into pure and non-injurious forms of religion 
is needed, not those that require much ado or 
those that are impure and harmful. Meditation 
should be on the Lord, not on sense-objects or on 
enemies with a view to revenge. Mantras such as 
Om are to be preferred, not those bringing worldly 
prosperity or causing injury to others. Purification 
of the mind is what we should be interested in, 
not merely trimming up the body or cleaning up 
houses. 36

PTHOL 




In the verses ' quoted above we have, from 
an authentic source, ill-important teachings on 
how to bring about desirable transformation in 
the gwi^combination in our mind. Control of 
mind, in its creative arid positive aspect, is this 
inner transformation. Until this is achieved no 
true work is really done for gaining control 
over the mind, ^r 

When through these and other means the 
aspirant has succeeded in ensuring the pre- 
ponderance of sattva in his nature, his battle 
for mincl-control is more than half won, but 
not fully, [ The reason is that even sattva binds 

■man. This is how the Glta puts it: 

I 

i Sattva > rajas and tamos — these gunas, O mighty- 
aimed", born of Prakrti, bind fast in the body the 
indestructible embodied one. 

Of these sattva, because of its stainlessness, 
luminous and free from evil, binds, O sinless one, 
by attachment to happiness and by attachment to 
knowledge. 37 

Sri Ramakrishna in his parable of the man 
and the three robbers, explains the matter as 
follows : 

This world itself is the forest, The three robbers 
prowling here are sattva , rajas and tamos. It is 
they that rob a man of the knowledge of Truth. 
Tamos wants to destroy him. Rajas binds him 
to the world. But sattva rescues him from the 
clutches of rajas arid tamas. Under the protection 



4

CHANGING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE MIND 



47 



of sattva, man is rescued from anger, passion, and 
other evil effects of tamos. Further, sattva loosens 
the bonds of the world But sattva also is a rob- 
ber. It cannot give him the ultimate knowledge 
of Truth, though it shows him the road leading 
to the supreme abode of God. Setting him on the 
path, sattva tells him: *Look yonder. There is 
your *home/ Even sattva is far away from the 
knowledge of Brahman, 88 

The psychological implication of the words 
of the Gita that 'sattva binds by attachment to 
happiness and attachment to knowledge*, and 
of Sri Ramakrishna, that 'sattva is also a rob- 
ber', is that even the preponderance of sattva 
in our nature does not amount to perfect con- 
trol of the mind. What is needed for gaining ( 
perfect control of the mind is to go beyond the 
gunas. Sri Krsna teaches the teachnique of going 
beyond the gunas in the fourteenth chapter of) 
the Gita. In verse twenty-six he gives the entire 
teaching in its' simplest form, shorn of all tech- 
nicalities. He says: 'And he who serves Me 
(the Lord) with unswerving devotion, he, going 
beyond the gunas, is fitted for becoming Brah- 
man/ .•-^ 
But only the pure in heart can serve God 
with unswerving devotion. If we feel that we 
are not so pure in heart and so cannot practise 
unswerving devotion, we must not be dis- 
couraged. Through the persistent practice of

devotion we can gradually become more un- 
swerving and pure. 

However, if for any reason we are not able 
to adopt the 'simplest method* of going beyond 
the gums, other ways of controlling the mind 
remain open to us. 

In addition to learning how to conquer tamas 
and rajas we need to learn how to conquer 
sattva also. This is taught by Sri Sarikaracarya 
thus : 

Tamas is destroyed by both sattva and rajas 
rajas by sattva, and sattva dies when purified! 
lnerefore do away with thy superimposition 
through the help of sattva®

HOLY COMPANY GREATLY HELPS 
MIND-CONTROL 



We have discussed in some detail one method 
of changing the guraa-composition of our mind 
for the purpose of controlling it. This is an 
authentic method taught in the scriptures. 



35 Vivekacudama$i, 278. 



HOLY COMPANY GREATLY HELPS MIND-CONTBOL 49 

When correctly practised it can help any one. 

There will, howtever, be many people who are 
so constituted that they cannot take inner care 
of themselves in such detail, or because their 
conditions of living are not conducive to the 
practice of this discipline. Is there any other 
discipline easier to practise but equally effec- 
tive? Yes, there is a discipline which is easier 
to practise, and is equally, if not more effective. 

But there is a difficulty in speaking about this 
very simple method. An illustration will show 
what we mean. There are some patients who, 
•having suffered a great deal from an obstinate 
ailment, do not really trust the doctor when he 
prescribes a simple remedy. They are inclined 
to think that a difficult disease needs corre- 
spondingly complicated treatment. The same is 
true of the simple method we are about to 
describe : for some people it is too simple. 

The method is that of being in holy company. 
It is a simple method, but more effective* than 
[ all others. Sri Krsna teaches : 

Yoga, discrimination, piety, study of the Vedas, 
austerities, renunciation, rites such as agnihotra, 
works of public utility, charity, vows, sacrifices, 
secret mantras, places of pilgrimage, and moral 
rules, particular as well as universal — none of 
these, I say, bind Me so much as association with 
saints, which roots out all attachment.*

THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 

Most of our attachments are due to the pre- 
ponderance of rajas in our riature. Wh6n we 
are in the company of a perfected soul, the 
powerful vibrations of his holiness penetrate 
within us and bring about a speedy change in 
the gt/7ia-composition of our mind, leading to 
a preponderance of "sattva- for the time being* 
How enduring this sa#t>a-dominance will be 
depends on how often we frequent holy com- 
pany. Sri Ramakrishna teaches: 

...The wordly man must constantly live in the 
company of holy men. It is necessary for all, even 
for* sannyasins ; but it is specially necessary for the 
householder. His disease has become chronic be- 
cause he has to live constantly in the midst of 
'woman and gold*.* 1 

Holy company makes our task of controlling 
the mind easier, so we must not fail to seek it. 
But when holy company is not available, what 
do we do? We must depend on our own re- 
sources and go ahead with hard and methodical 
work. Following those . of the above teachings 
which are suitable for us, we must bring about 
the preponderance of sattva in our mind, and 
finally learn how to transcend sattva by purify- 
ing it

HOW IS SATTVA PURIFIED 



According to Vedanta, the purification of 
sattva takes place through constant discrimina- 
tion between the real and the unreal, through 
renunciation of the unreal, and through deep 
contemplation on the true nature of the Self. 
In this connection what Sankaracarya teaches 
by implication on mind-control is helpful: 

The desire pf Self-realization is obscured by in- 
numerable desires for things other than the Self. 
When they have destroyed by constant attach- 
ment to the Self, the Atman clearly manifests Itself 
of Its own accord. 

As the mind becomes gradually established in 
the inmost Self, it proportionately gives up desires 
for external objects. And when all such desires 
have been eliminated, there takes place the unob- 
structed realization of the Atman. 

The yogi's mind dies, being constantly fixed on 
his own Self. Thence follows the cessation of de- 
sires. Therefore do away with your superimposi- 
tion.** 

This 'death* of the mind does not mean loss 
of the mind, but perfect purification*, in which 
state it is identified with the Atman. When one

THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 

t 

knows oneself as the Atman, there is no longer 
a mind needing control. 

In seeking to control of our mind we must as- 
pire to this absolute state of being. As long as 
we have more desires than one, or other desires 
than the desire for the realization of Atman, 
it will be difficult to control the mind, for it will 
then be in a scattered state. If we seek any- 
thing less than the highest, into which every- 
thing converges, as it were, the mind will be 
divided. It is hard to control a divided mind. 
In other words, those who seek anything less 
than perfect illumination, or realization of the 
Self, can never control their mind perfectly. 
They have some desire other than that for illu- 
mination and therefore they in effect vote for 
the perpetuation of aoidtjd. Thus they render 
themselves incapable of doing things needed for 
controlling the mind. In Vedanta, mind in its 
impure state is identified with avkhjd^ And so 
the disciplines that are enjoined for the removal 
of avidya are also applicable to mind-control. 
Of these disciplines one particularly is very 
helpful in controlling' the mind through its 
power of purification. This discipline, in Vedan- 
tic terminology, is swdhyasdpanayam, doing 
away with the superimposition that has come

identification with the non-Self. 

About super imposition on the Self and the 
method of its 'removal Sankaracarya teaches: 

The idea of 'me and mine* in the body, organs, 
etc., which are the non-Self- — this superimposition 
the wise man must put a stop to, by identifying 
himself with the Atman. 

Realizing your inmost Self, the witness of the 
buddhi (intellect) and its modifications* and con- 
stantly revolving the positive thought 1 am That', 
conquer the identification with the non-Self. 4 * 

All the disquiet, tension, and problems of the 
mind have only one origin, the false identifica- 
tion of one's real Self with the non-Self, giving 
rise to the idea of 'me and mine* in the body, 
the organs, etc.* 5 The cure of all these dis- 
orders is in the effective practice of the positive 
thought 1 am That'. 1 am the Atman/ The 
Reality-oriented mind alone can be controlled.

problem of mind-control as a matter of course. 
These Vedantic disciplines for controlling the 
mind can be helpfully supplemented by certain 
yoga disciplines which we shall now discuss. 



14 

BASIC YOGA DISCIPLINES FOR 
MIND-CONTROL 




The yoga scriptures insist that in order to 
control the mind aspirants must practise the 
disciplines of xjama and niyama. Non-killing, 
truthfulness, non-stealing, continence, and non- 
receiving of gifts are called yamas.* 7 Internal and 

i Discrimination between things permanent and 
transient. 



11 




Renunciation of the enjoyment of the fruits of 
action in this world and hereafter. 

iii The cultivation of six treasures: restraining the 
outgoing mental propensities ; restraining the ex- 
ternal sense-organs ; withdrawing the self ; for- 
bearance ; self-settledness ; and faith, 

iv Longing for liberation. 

(Sadananda, Vedantasara, 15.)

BASIC YOGA DISCIPLINES FOR MIND-CONTROL 



55 



external purification, contentment, mortification, 
study, and worship of God are the niyamas. 4 * 

Obviously one who is not yet the master of 
his mind will fail to observe some of these pre- 
cepts. Yet the idea of insisting on the practice 
of these virtues is to keep the ideal always 
bright before the practitioner, so that inner 
strength may grow through self-effort. Fatanjali, 
the great teacher of yoga, says : 

Undisturbed calmness of mind is attained by 
cultivating t 

a. Friendliness towards the happy. 

b. Compassion for the unhappy. 

c. Delight in the good. 

d. Indifference to the evil. 49 

This aphorism requires explanation. The dis- 
position of being happy at the happiness of 
others creates a very soothing mental climate 
in which wrong impulses like jealousy cannot 
thrive. 

Contraction of the heart causes us a special 
type of inner disquiet, and this can be removed 
only through the expansion of our heart. Prac- 
tising compassion for the unhappy is one of the 
methods of doing this. Active compassion will 
mean service to the afflicted. Service done in 
the proper attitude is purifying, It expands our

hearts, enhances our sense of identity with the 
whole, and liberates us from the cramping agony 
of our smallness. This gives us inner joy. 

Even if we ourselves are miserable, there will 
be no dearth of more miserable persons around 
us. Let us do something for somebody else. If 
we cannot do anything else, we may just be 
friendly and pray sincerely for the good of the 
world. That too will help. 

Our delight should be in the good. When we 
take delight in the good the psychological law 
is that we imbibe the goodness and the other 
qualities of the good. Goodness is conducive to 
calmness of mind. 

We. are asked to be indifferent to the evil. 
Undoubtedly to try to change evil people into 
good is a high and noble task. But that task 
is for the prophet and the saint, not for the 
ordinary man who is struggling with his own 
mind. As long as our own minds are not well 
under control, we should studiously avoid evil 
company. In that way we can save our own 
minds from catching the contagion and getting 
into greater trouble. If we feel so deeply for 
the evil and the wicked we can pray for their 
welfare. This will help both, them and us. 

But who are these wicked people? Who 
judges who is wicked? There can be a long 
controversy on this issue. For all practical 






BASIC YOGA DISCIPLINES FOR MIND-OONTROL 57 

purposes, however, those who live immoral and 
unethical lives can be considered wicked 
people. 

While avoidance of evil company is helpful 
for controlling the mind in a negative way, the 
company of the holy is helpful in the most 
positive manner; Holy company removes the 
mental impurities of even a degraded person. 

lis is what the saints and scriptures say, Sri 
Krsna teaches in the Srhnad Bhagavatam™ that 
association with the holy roots out all attach- 
ment. Our attachments are th emost powerf 
impediments to the control of the mind. I WherT 



attachments are removed, aversions and delu- 
sions also leave us easily, as a result of which 
w^Jittairi^nght discrimination and^clarity ol 
understanding. With these inner transformations 
unknowingly going on as a result of holy com- 
pany we find it possible to control the mind.

PRACTICE OF DISCRIMINATION HELPS 



There are situations in which we cto things 
deliberately, knowing full well that it is the 
right thing to do. And there are situations in 
which we act impulsively without knowing the 
right or wrong of them. But in either case every 
work bears its own fruits, sweet or bitter, 
j Apart from other sufferings one result of wrong 
>*— ^'action is greater mental turmoil. Our ignor- 
ance about" right and wrong will not save us 
from trouble. 

"~ Therefore in order to control the mind one 
essential thing is to learn how to discriminate 
between right and wrong, good and evil, real 
and unreal. When discrimination becomes a 
habit with us we shall automatically ask our- 
selves: What good is it? This will save us 
from possible mental turmoil resulting from 
wrong, rash and foolish actions, provided we 
have developed the habit of doing only what 
our discrimination tells us to be good. The 
practice of discrimination may very well go 
hand in hand with the practice of self-examina- 
tion. This conduces to self-improvement. 

There is another dimension to the practice of 
discrimination which helps the control of the 



PRACTICE OF DISCRIMINATION HELPS 

mind in a fundamental manner, The crux of 
the problem of mind-control was neatly put by 
the ancient seekers, Sanaka and others, to 
Brahma in these few words ; 

O Lord, the mind is attached to the sense-objects 
and the sense-objects influence the mind: So for 
the man who seeks liberation and wants to go 
beyond them, how do they cease to act and react 
upon each other? 51 

The crux of the problem remains the same 
even today, And given a universe on the same 
plan, it will ever remain so. The authoritative 
answer that came from Sri Krsna to this im- 
portant question has been summarized in the 
following words : 

If the mind, which is connected with sense- 
objects as agent and enjoyer etc, and is variously 
named as intellect, egoism and so forth, were the 
• reality of the jiva (living being), then there might 
not be a dissolution of the , connection between 
the fwa and the sense-objects. But the jiva is 
eternally identified with Brahman, and his appar- 
ent connection with the sense-objects is due to 
the superimposition of the mind on him, Hence 
by considering oneself to be Brahman and reflect- 
ing on the unreality of the sense-objects, one should 
turn away from them and worship the Lord so 
that one can remain in one's true nature as the 
infinite Self. 53

TRAINING THE MIND TO BFMAVE 






In one sense to control the mind is to train 
it to behave. It is like catching a wild horse 
and turning it into a circus horse to do feats 
to order. How is it done ? 

Swami Vivekananda teaches; 

Before we can control the mind we must study 
it. 

We have to seize this unstable mind and drag 
it from its wanderings and fix it on one idea. 
Over and over again this must be done. By power 
of will we must get hold of the mind and make 
it stop and reflect upon the glory of God. 

The easiest way to get hold of the mind is to 
sit quiet and let it drift where it will for a while. 
Hold fast to the idea,, T am the witness watching 
my mind drifting. The mind is not 1/ Then see 
it think as if it were a thing entirely apart from 
yourself* Identify yourself with God, never with 
matter or with the mind.* Picture the mind as a 
calm lake stretched before you and the thoughts 
that come and go as bubbles rising and breaking 
on its surface. Make no effort to control the 
thoughts, but watch them and follow them in 
imagination as they float away. This will gradually 
lessen the circles. For the mind ranges over wide 
circles of thought and those circles widen- out into 
ever increasing circles, as in a pond when we throw 
a stone into it We want to reverse the process 
and starting with a huge circle make it narrower 



TRAINING THE MIND TO BEHAVE 



61 



until at last we can fix the mind on one point and 
make it stay there. Hold to the idea, 1 am not the 
mind, I see that I am thinking, I am watching 
my mind act*, and each day the identification of 
yourself with thought and feeling will grow less, 
until at last you can entirely separate yourself from 
the mind and actually know it to be apart from 
yourself. 

When this is done, the mind is your servant 
to control as you will. The first stage . of being 
a yogi is to go beyond the senses. When the 
mind is conquered, he has reached the highest 
stage. 63 ' 

We shall be surprised to see, when we 
begin this practice, how many hideous thoughts 
will come to our mind. As the practice 
continues the turbulence of the mind may 
increase for some time. But the more detached 
from our minds we shall find it possible to 
feel ourselves, the less will be its pranks. 
Gradually its vagaries will lose all vigour under 
the penetrating gaze of the observer, and 
finally the mind will become like a circus 
horse, vigorous but disciplined. We should for 
some time deliberately watch our minds every 
day at regular intervals. And this should 
continue as long as the mind needs to be 
taught how to behave.

PRACTICE OF PRAtyAYAMA 




We shall notice that when our mind is in a 
disturbed state our breathing becomes faster 
and irregular. One- of the ways of quieting 
the mind is to regularize the breathing. Regu- 
lar practice of deep breathing helps to develop 
a stable state of mind, — 

It may be mentioned here that the practice 
of pranatjama (restraining the breath in order 
to get control of the prdna or vital force) is very 
helpful for controlling the mind. Pranayama 
should, however, be learnt directly from a 
teacher, and should be practised in a clean 
■ atmosphere. Besides, those who do not prac 
tise continence, or have a diseased heart, lungs 
or nervous system, are advised not to practise 
pranatjama. 



28 



PRACTICE OF FRATYAHARA 



Usually our .condition is that we are forced 
to concentrate our minds on certain things. 
There are attractions in objects which compel 
our minds to become fixed on them. In this 
way we become the slaves of tempting objects. 
The true position, however, should be that we 
put our minds on things at will. Things should 
not be able to force our minds on them. 
Learning to do this is a most important step 
in controlling the mind. In fact, until we learn 
to do this, nothing is practically achieved by 
way of controlling the mind. 

Now, how do we do this ? Swami Viveka- 
nanda teaches: 

We hear 'Be good*, and 'Be good', and 'Be 
good', taught all over the world. There is hardly 
a child, born in any country in the world, who 
has not been told, 'Do not steal', 'Do not tell a lie', 
but nobody tells the child how he can help doing 
theiri. Talking will not help him. Why should he 
not become a thief? Wc do not teach him how 
not to steal; we simply tell him, 'Do not steal.' 
Only when we teach him to control his mind 
do we really help him. AH actions, internal and 
external, occur when the mind joins itself to 
certain centres, called the organs. Willingly or un- 
willingly it is drawn to join itself to centres, and 



[E MIND AND ITS CONTROL 




that is why people do foolish deeds and feel miser- 
able, which, if the mind were under control, they 
would not do. What would, be the result of con- 
trolling the mind ? It then would not join itself 
to the centres of perception, and, naturally, feeling 
and willing would be under control. It is clear 
so far. Is it possible ? It is perfectly possible. 54 

It can be done by practising the discipline of 
pratyahara which is taught by Patafijali, 

What is pratyahara ? Pratyahara is that ab- 
stention by which the senses do not dome into 
contact with their objects and follow, as it 
were, the nature of the (controlled) mind. 



It 



When the mind is withdrawn from the sense- 
objects the sense-organs also withdraw themselves 
from their objects and they are said Jo imitate 
the mind. This is known as pratyahara** 

The link between the sense-organs and sense- 
objects is the mind. When the mind is with- 
drawn from sense-objects, the sense-organs also 
imitate the mind, that is to say, they also with- 
draw themselves from their objects. When the 
mind is restrained, the senses are then auto- 
matically restrained. This example illustrates 
the point: just as the bees fly when the queen 
flies, and alight when the queen alights, so the 
senses become restrained when the mind is 
restrained. This is pratyahara. ■

IMPORTANCE OF HARMONIOUS HUMAN RELATIONS 

The entire secret of pratyahara is will-power, £h 
which every normal person is capable of devel- 
oping; but in most people it is in an undevel- 
oped state. When confirmed in pratyahara one 
attains mastery oyer ones senses, thoughts and * 
emotions, Practice of pratyahara helps develop 
will-power and will-power helps develop pratya- 
hara.

TI-IE MIND AND XTS CONTROL 




Those who want to control their minds must 
not store up ill-feelings or grievances or other 
wrong impulses in the mind, which is to be 
used for higher purposes. Through doing one's 
duties to others, and through the practice of 
detachment, forgiveness and humility, we must 
keep our human relations straight. Holy 
Mother says; 'Forgiveness is tapasya (auster- 
ity).* 57 

A healthy mind is much easier to control 
than an unhealthy or broken mind. Here is a 
case history which will indicate how forgive- 
ness helps in restoring the health of the mind. 
Years ago, Dr. Jung suggested that psychol- 
ogists and clergymen should join hands in 
alleviating human suffering. The American 
Magazine of October 1947 published an article 
describing a remarkable clinic of this kind 
designed to mend broken souls and restore 
shattered faith: 

A thirty-four-year-old woman came to this clinic. 
She looked like a woman of fifty and had for 
months suffered from insomnia, nervousness and 
chronic fatigue. She had consulted doctors, but to 
no avail. Religious at heart, she tried to pray but 
without success. She finally became so depressed 
that she wanted to commit suicide, The clinic 
psychiatrist discovered the real cause of her illness : 
a deep resentment towards her sister who' had

married the man she herself wanted to marry* 
Outwardly she was kind to her sister, but deep in 
her subconscious mind she cherished a terrible 
bar ted which ruined her mental and physical 
health. Then a minister' came to her aid. *You 
know it* is evil to hate. You must ask God to help 
you to forgive your sister in your heart ; then God 
will give you peace/ She followed this advice. 
1 Through prayer and faith in a power greater than 
herself she has been able to forgive her sister. 
Her depression and insomnia are gone. She is a 
new person and happier than ever before/ 68 



20 

HEALTHY OCCUPATION OF THE 
MIND NEEDED 



The common saying 'an idle brain is the 
devil's workshop* is very true. Therefore the 
mind must be given healthy and creative occu- 
pation. It should be fed with high thoughts 
and noble inspiration. Otherwise it will drift 
to low things and become scattered. In its 
scattered state the mind cannot be controlled. 

If we can penetrate to the core of the un- 
steadiness of our mind, there we shall discover

Life, Sri Ramakrishna Math, Madras, 1959 } pp. 159-60. 



68 



THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 



as its cause a wrong thought, or many wrong 
thoughts, one acting upon another. So, to 
steady the mind we need to guard our thoughts 
with maximum steadfastness. There are these 
Buddhist teachings: 

As a fletcher makes straight bis arrow, a wise 
man makes straight his trembling and unsteady 
thought, which is difficult to guard, difficult to 
hold back. 

Let the wise man guard his thoughts, for they 
are difficult to perceive, very artful and they msh 
wherever they listeth ; thoughts well-guarded bring 
happiness. 

If a man's thoughts are not dissipated, if his 
mind is not perplexed, if it has ceased to think of 
good and evil then there is no fear for him while 
he is watchful. 69 

Right introspection will reveal that inadvert- 
ence is at the root of much of our mental 
turmoil. And inadvertence comes to us so 
naturally because we are not trained in culti- 
vating our mind for higher inner" occupations. 
Sii Sarikaracarya teaches : 

One should never be careless in one's steadfast- 
ness to Brahman. Bhagavan Sanatkumiira, who 
is Brahma's son, has called inadvertence death 
itself. 

There is no greater danger for the jiianin than 
carelessness about his own real nature. From this 
comes delusion, thence egoism ; this is followed 
by bondage, and then comes misery. 



69 Dhammapada, verses 33, 36, 39. 



HEALTHY OCCUPATION OF THE MIND NEEDED 



69 



Finding even a wise man hankering after sense- 
objects, oblivion torments him through the evil 
propensities of the buddhi, as a woman does her 
doting paramour. 

As sedge, even if removed , does not stay away 
for a moment, but covers the water again, so 
Maya or Nescience also covers even a wise" man, 
if he is averse to meditation on the Self. 

If the mind ever so slightly strays from the 
Ideal and becomes outgoing, then it goes down 
and down, just as a play-ball inadvertently 
dropped on the staircase bounds down from one 
step to another. 60 

Steadfast cultivation of awareness of the 
highest objective of life, which is the Supreme 
Spirit, is a potent method of steadying the 
mind. In fact, when we practise this discipline 
we shall derive greater benefit from other 
practices. 

A healthy preoccupation of the mind need 
not necessarily be monotonous. If it should be, 
it might turn into unhealthy drudgery. There 
can be a chosen, • refreshing variety to ensure 
the healthy preoccupation of the mind, Sri 
Krsna teaches: 

i # ■ 

Charity, the performance of one's duty, the obser- 
vance of vows, general and particular, the hearing 
of the scriptures, meritorious acts, and all other 
works — all these culminate in the control of the 
mind. The control of the mind is the highest 
yoga.* 1

IMPORTANCE OF RIGHT USE 
OF THE IMAGINATION 



Man is endowed with the faculty of imagina- 
tion. A great deal of our mental troubles and 
difficulties in controlling the mind arises from 
our habitual wrong use of this faculty* It is 
common practice with many of us to indulge 
in what is called emotional kite-flying, day- 
dreaming, and wild, meaningless and purpose- 
less speculation of various sorts. Our expec- 
tations may be imaginary, without any basis 
in fact, but they bring us real disappointments. 
Our fears may be baseless, but they cause 
genuine trepidation in our heart. Through 
exercising our power of imagination we make 
unreal things real for Ourselves. And we 
become victims of worries and concerns for 
which there is no factual basis. When this 
habit becomes a hardened one, it is extremely 
difficult to control the mind. Sometimes we 
may not even be aware of the fact that for a 
good part of our day we live in a dreamland, 
in a world of shadows and not in that of truth 
and facts. 

Unless we get rid of this habit we shall find 
it extremely difficult to control the mind. How 






IMPORTANCE OF RIGHT USE OF THE IMAGINATION 71 



do we do it? The following story will give 
us an important clue: 

A somewhat inebriated gentleman was slowly 
moving along the street, carrying in his hand a 
box with perforations on the lid and sides. It 
appeared he was carrying some live animal in the 
box. An acquaintance stopped him and asked, 
'What have you got in the box?' 

'It is a mongoose' replied the tipsy man. 

'What on earth for?* 

'Well you know how it is with me ; I am not 
really drunk now, but soon I shall be. And 
when I am, I see snakes all around and I get 
awfully scared. That is what I have the mon- 
goose for, to protect me from the snakes,* 

'Good heavens, those are all imaginary snakes I' 

This also, is* an imaginary mongoose!' 

The box was in fact empty. 63 

Similarly we require one imagination to 
counteract another. We require a right imag- 
ination to throw out wrong ones. Swami 
Vivekananda teaches: Imagination properly 
employed is our greatest friend ; it goes 
beyond reason and is the only light that takes 
us everywhere/ 63 The purest of imaginations 
is the thought of God. The more we cling 
to the thought of God, the less will be our 
trouble with the mind.

22 



IMPORTANCE OF MKx 




Meditation on God is the most effective way 
of controlling the mind, Meditation and con- 
trol of the mind go hand in hand. The 
highest objective for which one controls the 
mind is meditation on God or Atman as the 
case may be. However, meditation also helps 
control of the mind. 

The mind must be riveted on something 
which is not only pure in itself but can also 
purify our mind through its power. Meditation 
on God is advised, because one becomes 
imbued with the quality of the object on 
which one meditates. 

In meditation, whenever the mind strays 
away one should indefatigably bring it back 
and place it on the object of meditation. 
Swami Brahmananda, one of the great direct 
disciples of Sri Ramakrishna, says: 



Unless you meditate, the mind cannot be con- 
trolled, and unless the mind is controlled,,, you can- 
not meditate. But if you think, 'First let me 
control the mind and then I shall meditate*, you 
will never enter the path of spiritual life. You 



GUARD AGAINST DESPONDENCY 



73 



must do both at the same time — steady your mind 
and meditate. 6 ' 

So, when once a disciple asked Swami 
Brahmananda, 'Maharaj, how can one control 
the mind?* the teacher, in effect, explained how 
the above instruction was to be put into 
practice. He said: 

Through gradual practice the mind has to be 
concentrated upon God, Keep a sharp eye on the 
mind so that no undesirable thoughts or distrac- 
tions may enter in. Whenever they try to crowd 
in on your mind, turn it toward God and pray 
earnestly. Through such practice the mind comes 
under control and becomes purified. 65 



23 



GUARD AGAINST DESPONDENCY 



These are the basic disciplines. They 
should be regularly practised by those who 
intend to control their minds. While steadfastly

74 



THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 



practising these disciplines, the aspirant's motto 
should be: struggle, struggle and struggle; 
never give in. 

We must not allow despondency to eat into 
our earnestness and energy. Despondency is 
the worst enemy of spiritual life. So it should 
be cast out whenever it presents itself. 

When we are in the worst of mental states 
and feel as though we shall never rise again 
to meet the demands of inner struggle, we are 
advised to stand behind the mind, and see our 
mental state as something from which we are 
separate. We should never identify ourself 
with any of the mental states, good or bad, 
for, our real Self, the Atman, is not the mind. 

When in a low state we must drive out all 
negative thoughts by repeating to ourself with 
all our might: lam divine, identical with the 
Supreme Spirit. No misery can ever touch me ; 
I am ever free, infinite and immortal.* 86 Or we 
can repeat with firm conviction: 'If God be 
for us who can be against us/ 67 Thus the 
low state of mind will pass away.

EMERGENCY CONTROL DEVICES 



It will be within almost everyone's experience 
that even while earnestly practising the basic 
disciplines, we come into headlong clash with 
powerful inimical forces, thoughts, urges, ten- 
dencies, and emotions which tend to tear down 
all our good work in the mind. To deal with 
such critical situations we have to develop 
some high-power emergency controls. Like the 
fire-fighters of a city our methods must be 
ready at hand day and night 

Patailjali, the teacher of Raja-Yoga, calls this 
method pratipaksabhavanar.i, or thinking con- 
trary thoughts. In the relevant aphorism he 
says: 'When thoughts obstructive to control of 
the mind arise, contrary thoughts should be 
employed, 768 

For instance, you notice that a big wave of 
anger is just rising in your mind, which will 
not only upset your peace for long but cause 
you great harm, What should you do to 
neutralize the wave? You have to raise a 
contrary wave, a wave of love. If lust assails 

88 Yoga-sutra, II. 33, 34, 







76 



[K M 



AND 




you, you have to raise a contrary wave of 
purity. This can be done by thinking intensely 
on the pure heart of a saint. 

But contrary thoughts have to be raised at 
the very inception of inimical ones. There is 
a stage when your anger is just a bubble in 
your mind ; and there is a stage when you are 
anger itself. Contrary thoughts should be raised 
when the first bubbles arise ; otherwise the 
method will not work. Contrary thoughts will 
be powerless when the harmful ones have had 
time to develop. From this we can under- 
stand what a close watch we have to keep on 
our thoughts and emotions. 

It is possible that we may not notice the first 
few bubbles and may become aware of the 
situation only when the waves have risen pretty 
high. What shall we do in this situation? We 
must tear ourselves away from the situation and 
go to a lonely place for self-confrontation. 
There we must catch our mind by the throat* 
as it were, and say to it : 'O my mind, this 
will ruin you altogether. Don't you see that?' 
If we impress the idea forcefully upon the 
mind> it will behave ; for it does not want self- 
destruction. 

When a disciple once asked Swami Brahma- 
nanda: What should I do if a distracting 



EMERGENCY CONTROL DEVICES 



77 



thought persistently arises hi my mind? he 
replied : 

'This thought is immensely harmful to me- It 
will be my ruin/ Impress this idea again and 
again upon your mind. The mind will be freed 
from that distracting thought. 

The mind is susceptible to suggestions. It 
learns whatever you teach it. If through discrimi- 
nation you can impress upon it the joy and full- 
ness of life in the spirit and the folly of worldly 
attachments, then your mind will devote itself 
more and more to God. 09 

Nothing is more exhausting than wrestling 
with the mind. The more we are exhausted 
the more turbulent the mind becomes ; and 
ultimately we are swept away. In such a situa- 
tion a frontal attack on the mind is not very 
helpful. What should we do then? We should 
cease to identify ourselves with the mind. If 
we do this a tremendous work will have been 
done. 

As long as we identify ourselves with the 
mind we cannot control bur minds. The 
moment we succeed by philosophic thought in 
separating ourselves from the mind, it has 
nothing to stand on from where it can make 
trouble. 

But the work in this regard is finished and 
permanent only when the ignorance of egoism 
is destroyed. Patanjali defines egoism as the 

w Swami Prabhavananda, op. tit, pp. 135-36. 










78 



THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 



identification of the seer or Atman with the 
instruments of seeing, which are the senses, 
intellect and mind. 70 All our sins and troubles 
are rooted in this egoism. Therefore an effec- 
tive way of controlling the rebellious and way- 
ward state of the mind, is to dissociate ourself 
from it. 



25 



DIRECTED THOUGHT 



There are other devices which may be 
effectively employed in an inner emergency 
created by the sudden onrush of temptation, 
anger, lust, greed or hatred, succumbing to any 
one of which may render control of the mind 
simply impossible. 

Teaching what we should do when we 
watch ourselves being, greatly tempted, a West- 
ern mystic suggests the following practical 
measures 71 which can be practised by anyone 

70 Yoga-sutra, II. 6.

pp. 240-41, 



DIRECTED THOUGHT 

in distress anywhere in the world. These pre- 
cepts, with such adaptations as are necessary, 
will be found helpful in all inner emergencies: 

1. Follow the example of children when they 
see a wolf or a bear in the country. They imme- 
diately run to the arms of their father or mother, 
or at least they call out to them for help and 
assistance. Turn in like manner to God, and 
implore His mercy and His help. This is the 
remedy that our Lord has taught t 'Pray that ye 
enter not into temptation/ 

2. Protest that your will never consent to the 
temptation ; implore His assistance against it ; and 
continue always to protest that you will refuse 
your consent as long as the temptation shall 
continue. 

3. When you make these protestations and 
these refusals of consent, do not look the temp- 
tation in the face, but look only on our Lord. 
If you look upon the temptation, especially when 
it is strong, it may shake your courage. 

4. Turn your thought to some good and 
commendable matter. When good thoughts enter 
and occupy your heart, they drive away every 
temptation and evil suggestion. 

5. The sovereign remedy against all tempta- 
tions, whether great or small, is to lay open your 
heart and communicate its suggestions, feelings 
and affections to your director (same as Guru). 

6. If the temptation should still continue to 
harass and persecute us after all this, we have 
nothing to do on our part, but to continue reso- 
lute in our protestations never to consent to it. 
As girls can never be wed as long as they answer 
no, so the soul, no matter how long the tempta- 
tion may last, can never sin as long as she says 
no. 



80 



THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 




Psychologically speaking what we need to do 
in such an inner situation is to calm down the 
powerful inimical wave which has arisen in the 
mind, If we ceaselessly call on God, every 
breath being a call and giving birth to another 
call, there is then no loophole through which 
the inimical thought can assert itself- and be 
translated into action. The strategy is to cause 
a more powerful explosion of helpful thought 
in order to counteract the explosion of involun- 
tary inimical thought By constant, even frantic, 
calling on God or on one's own higher self, by 
repetition of a mantra, if one is initiated, or of 
a divine name, a higher impulse will be set 
going within us to take care of the emergency. 

We have to be particularly watchful that 
though beset by inimical tendencies, we do not 
give our inner consent to them. Tendencies are 
not sins. It is the inner consent to wrong 
tendencies that constitutes sin, 

Sri Ramakrishna teaches: 

All tibe sins of the body fly away if one chants 
the name of God and sings His glories. The 
birds of sin dwell in the tree of the body. Sing- 
ing the name of God is like clapping your hands. 
As, at a clap of the hands, the birds in the tree 
fly away, so do our sins disappear at the chanting 
of God's name and glories. 73 

In this homely precept Sri Ramakrishna 



73 M., op. cit„ p. 105. 





DIRECTED THOUGHT 

presents us with a simple remedy for a diffi- 
cult situation, and this can easily be put into 
practice by all who are genuinely anxious to 
get out of it 

In the same vein Swami Brahmananda 
teaches : 

Japam, japam, japam . . . let the wheel of the 
name of God go round in the midst of all activ- 
ities. , . . All the burning of the heart will be 
soothed. Don't you know how many sinners have 
}>ecome pure and free and divine by taking refuge 
in the name of God? 73 

Keep a sharp eye on the mind so that no 
undesirable thought or distractions may enter in. 
Whenever they try to crowd into your mind, turn 
it toward God and pray earnestly. Through such 
practice the mind comes under control and 
becomes purified. 71 

All the above precepts imply the effective- 
ness of taking refuge in God. Yet it is neces- 
sary to emphasize that those who believe in 
God, for them the surest remedy in such a 
situation is to take whole-souled refuge in 
God, Lay your heart bare before God, and 
cry a genuine cry for His mercy. The Lord 
Himself asks the devotee to take refuge in Him 
and also gives the assurance: C I will liberate 
you from all sins'; 75 He further declares: 'My 

73 Swami Prabhavananda, op. cit P1 p. 166.

82 THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 

devotee will never perish/ 76 Another well- 
known Hindu scripture attests that the Divine 
Mother removes the sufferings of all who, being 
dejected and distressed, take refuge in Her." 
The same scripture offers adoration to the 
Divine Mother saying: 

Where raksasas and snakes of virulent poison 
(are), where foes and hosts of robbers (exist), where 
forest conflagrations (occur), there in mid-ocean 
you stand* and save the world, 78 

If this be true — and we believe it to be true- 
will She not save us when we take refuge in 
Her in our personal conflagrations? 

In the same vein Christ calls to the distressed : 

Gome unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy 
laden, and I shall give you rest, 79 

These distinct invitations from the Lord's 
side are there^ before the devotee. What sense 
does it make not to accept this invitation and 
suffer? For the devotee, therefore, enough 
and more measures exist for meeting an inner 
emergency. He has only to put into practice 
one of the methods or a combination of them 
suited to his ability and purpose. 

The question arises, if a person is a

63 



non-believer, what does he do in such inner 
emergencies as we have been considering? 

Let him first tear himself away from the 
locale of the situation, go out for a brisk long 
walk in the company of his higher self, as it 
were, and try to put his mind onto something 
elevating and commendable. If for want of 
faith he cannot cry to God and lay his inside 
bare for divine Inspection, let him turn to 
Nature — a flowing river, the sky, the wind, a 
towering cliff of a mountain, to the vast ocean 
or the rising sun — and narrate his story 
candidly and ask understanding and power for 
self -transcendence. 

Better than this, however, will be to commu- 
nicate one's inner situation to a wise, trust- 
worthy selfless man of character and seek his 
advice and help. Such a person should be 
very carefully selected. If a trustworthy person 
is not available, it is better to fight one's inner 
battle oneself. 

What the non-believer should try to do in 
an emergency is to get out of the mental 
prison of inner diflSculty, into the vastness of 
the open where he can take wing and leave 
the turmoil to take care of itself. He must 
contrive an escape-hatch out of the immediate 
psychological situation into a larger universe of 
meaning. This he can perhaps do even by 
holding on to an inspiring line of a poem or

song, or* by recalling a great work of art or a 
few stirring words of a noble mind, One or 
another of these may serve as a window on 
eternity for him and enable him to rise to his 
higher self. 

But an escape from an oppressive inner 
situation, while absolutely necessary as a tempo- 
rary measure, is neither a final nor a funda- 
mental answer to the problem. For this the 
non-believer will do well to steadily practise 
these disciplines of therapeutic and spiritual 
value taught by Patanjali: 

Or he can try to think deeply on the effulgent 
light which is beyond all sorrow ; or on the heart 
'that has given up all attachments to sense objects ; 
or on anything that appeals to him as good. 80

control of the subconscious. The special 
discipline for urgent operations will function 
smoothly only in case the general disciplines for 
basic control are practised. 

The most imptirtant thing in the general 
discipline is the control of thought. One who 
knows how to regulate his thinking will know 
how to control his mind, 

How do we control our thoughts? 

Thought-control in the initial stage does not 
mean that there will be no thought in the 
mind at all. A thoughtless state may be a 
stupid state. In the initial stage thought- 
control means developing the capacity delib- 
erately to think good thoughts and to desist 
from thinking bad or wrong ones. 

In one of his sermons, after preaching in 
some detail on the method of thought-control, 
Buddha summarized his teaching: 

Remember, bhikkhus, the only way to become 
victorious over wrong thoughts is to review from 
time to time the phases of one's mind, to reflect 
on them, to root out all that is evil and to cultivate 
all that is good. 81 , 

Swami Vivekananda teaches: 

We are what our thoughts made us ; so take 
care what you think. Words are secondary. 
Thoughts live, they travel far.. Each thought we 
think is tinged with our character, so that for the

pure, and holy man, even his jest or abuse will 
have the twist of his own love and purity and 
do good. 82 

This taking 'care of what- you think' is so 
important that we must set about learning 
how to do it. In other words we must learn 
how to manufacture good thoughts. If we 
intend to manufacture good thoughts, we must 
be careful what food we take, not only by 
mouth but through all our senses. This we 
discussed earlier. If the food is pure, our 
thought will be pure ; if the food is impure so 
will our thought be. It is no use taking wrong 
food and so making it necessary to struggle to 
suppress the resultant wrong thoughts. In fact 
thought-control does not at all mean suppres- 
sion of thought but mastery of it. 

In its highest stage thought-control of course 
means complete cessation of thought. As long 
as we identify ourselves with the ego or the 
body we cannot reach this stage. What Swami 
Vivekananda teaches in the following lesson 
on prandydma indicates the processes by which 
cessation of thought is attained : 

...Identify yourself only with God. After a 
while thoughts will announce their coming, and 
we shall learn the way they begin and be aware 
of what we are going to think, just as on this 
plane we can look out and see a person coming.

CONTROL OF THOUGHT: THE SECRET 



87 



This stage is reached when we have learnt to 
separate ourselves from our minds and see our- 
selves as one and thought as something apart. Do 
not let the thoughts grasp you ; stand aside and 
they will die away. 

Follow these holy thoughts (of the Chosen Ideal 
or Om) ; go with them ; and when they melt away, 
you will find the feet of the Omnipotent God. 
This is the superconscious state ; when the idea 
melts, follow it and melt with it. 83 

We should not, however, be over-zealous to 
attain cessation of thought, without practising 
the disciplines leading to the state. It is better 
to keep the mind filled will holy thoughts as 
much as possible, as a result of which the 
mind will be purified. When purity of mind 
is attained cessation of thought comes of itself. 

Repetition of the Gayatri mantra greatly 
helps control of the mind, The meaning of the 
mantra is as follows: 

We meditate upon the adorable effulgence of the 
resplendent vivifier, Savitr ; may He stimulate our 
intellect. 84 

This in effect is a prayer for clarity of under- 
standing, which grows out of purity of mind. 
The purer the mind, as said before, the easier 
it is to control.

THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 



mantra Om helps the control of the mind in 
a fundamental way. He teaches: 

lie (God) is indicated by the mystic syllable 
Om. The repetition of that Om and the contem- 
plation of its import (God) are means of achieving 
concentration. Thereby is gained inwardness of 
thought and freedom, from obstacles to concen- 
tration. 85 

Inwardness of thought and concentration are 
gained when the mind is controlled. Com- 
menting on the second and third of these 
aphorisms of Pataxijali, Swami Vivekananda 
writes : 



*■« 



Why should there be repetition? We have not 
forgotten the theory of sarhskciras, that the sum 
total of impressions lives in the mind. They be- 
come more and more latent but remain there, and 
as soon as they get the right stimulus, they come 
out. Molecular vibration never ceases. When this 
universe is destroyed, all the massive vibrations 
disappear; the sun, moon, stars, and earth, melt 
down \ but the vibrations remain in the atoms. 
Each atom performs the same function as the big 
worlds do. So even when the vibrations of the 
citta subside, its molecular vibrations go on, and 
when they get the impulse, come out again. We 
can now understand what is meant by repetition. 
It is the greatest stimulus that can be given to 
the spiritual samskaras* 'One moment of company 
with the holy makes a ship to cross this ocean of 
life.' Such is the power of association. So this 
repetition of Om and thinking of its meaning is 
keeping good company in your own mind. Study, 



85 Yoga-sutra, I. 27-29.

and then meditate on what you have studied. Thus 
light will come to you, the Self will become mani- 
fest. 

But one must think of Om, and of its meaning 
too. Avoid evil company, because the scars of old 
wound are in you, and evil company is just the 
thing that is necessary to call them out In the 
same way we are told that good company will 
call out the good impressions that are in us, but 
which have become latent. There is nothing holier 
in the world than to keep good company, because 
the good impressions will then tend to come to 
the surface. 

The first manifestation of the repetition and 
thinking of Om is that the introspective power will 
manifest more and more, all the mental and physi- 
cal obstacles will begin to vanish. 86

CONTROL OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND 



It will be hard to demarcate exclusively the 
conscious and subconscious levels of the mind. 
Yet for all practical purposes it is found con- 
venient to use such terms for handling the 
problem under consideration. Discipline meant

THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 



for controlling the mind on the conscious level 
cannot leave the subconscious wholly un- 
affected, and vice versa. What we have dis- 
cussed so far, however, directly concerns the 
conscious level. 

We now turn to the control of the sub- 
conscious mind, as a natural extension of our 
work on the conscious level. We all have ex- 
perienced this strange phenomenon in our life: 
we know what is right but we cannot act up 
to it ; we know what is wrong but we cannot 
desist from doing it. We make very good 
resolutions, but before we are aware of it, like 
the sand-dyke before a tidal wave, they are 
washed away. We stand bewildered and frus- 
trated. 

An examination of this situation will show 
that we are making resolutions with the con- 
scious part of the mind, and we ourselves are 
frustrating our resolutions with another part of 
it, the subconscious, of which we know little. 
It is an unlighted region of the mind. 

The moment we seriously try to control our 
minds we are beset with inner difficulties. The 
more we persist, for a time the greater our 
difficulties may become. In surprise we ask . 
ourselves *What! am I getting worse day by 
day and that since taking religion seriously?* 
We have not to be worried if the situation is 
like this. This is exactly as it usually is. What 



* 






CONTOOL OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND 



91 



happens is this: in the event of deliberately 
trying to control our conscious mind, we come 
into clash with the opposing forces of our 
subconscious mind. These opposing forces are 
nothing but our stored up samskaras, past 
impressions and tendencies. Whatever we think 
and do leaves a potent impression in our mind. 
These impressions pop up from the subcon- 
scious mind and seek expression and remanifes- 
tation. When they are inconsistent with what 
we have been thinking with the conscious 
mind, that causes strife. 

The subconscious mind is like the cellar in 
a house, You do not know how much junk is 
there, until one day you think you will clear 
it. As you begin, you are not sure what kind 
of things and bugs you will encounter. Soon 
you are tired and leave the work unfinished. 
So the cellar remains a cellar, it is seldom fit 
to be a living room. But unless we clear the 
cellar of the subconscious mind we can never 
be sure of controlling the conscious mind. 
Therefore we must find ways of clearing this 
dark region of the subconscious mind. How 
do we do it? 

Suppose we want to cleans an ink-pot. 
How do we do it? We pour clean water into 
the pot. As the dry ink gets soaked darker 
water comes out for some time, Then clearer 
and less inky water comes out. At last we do 






92 



THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 




not find a trace of ink.. Clear water poured in 
causes clear water to come out of the pot. 

One of the ways of clearing the subconscious . 
mind is to pour holy thoughts into our mind 
and allow them to go deep down within our- 
self. Holy thoughts are like pure water. Only 
we must not get frightened when we find dark 
water coming out from within ourselves at a 
particular stage. If we persist in pouring in 
holy thoughts, a time will come when we 
shall find holy thoughts coming out from within. , 
The subconscious mind can then be taken to 
have been cleared. Control of the conscious 
mind will not be difficult then. 

We must not think that the subconscious is 
the storehouse of evil only. The subconscious 
also stores up all our past good and noble 
thoughts and experiences in seed form. So in 
the subconscious we do have, stored up, both 
help for, and opposition to, our efforts at 
controlling the mind. Our task will be to re- 
duce the opposition and increase the help. 
Sri Krsna assured Arjuna in the Gltff 7 that the 
yogi who strays away from the path does not 
come to eternal grief, for his good work is 
stored up, and in the next birth he is united 
with the intelligence acquired in his former 
body. This union with the intelligence 







87 VI. 43. 




CONTROL OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND 

acquired in the previous body can be a power- 
ful unknown factor in this life's attempts at 
controlling our mind. If this intelligence 
formerly acquired is to be said to have any 
particular locus, that locus is the subconscious 
mind. 

So to control the mind, important work 
needs to be done in the subconscious. On the 
other hand, if we do not aim at the attain- 
ment of life's goal, which is the experience of 
the superooiiscious state, we cannot really 
control our mind, conscious and subconscious. 
It is only the experience - of the superconscious 
state, or the vision of God, that destroys all 
the attachments, aversions and delusions, which 
cause the disturbances and disquiet of the 
mind. 

Our attempts at controlling the mind, there- 
fore, must have reference on the one hand to 
the subconscious mind and on the other to the 
superconscious, In other words our entire 
existence is involved in the process of. con- 
trolling the mind. Laying stress on the vastness 
of the task of controlling the mind, Swami 
Vivekananda points out why our study and 
efforts cannot remain confined only to the 
conscious plane: 

The task before us is vast; and first and fore- 
most we must seek to control the vast mass of 
sunken thoughts which have become automatic with 



94 




us. The evil deed is no doubt on the conscious 
piano but the cause which produced the evil 
deed was far beyond in the realms of the 
unconscious, unseen, and therefore more potent- * 

He therefore underscores the importance of 
controlling the unconscious' — here no distinc- 
tion is being made between subconscious and 
unconscious — for reasons irrefutable. He 
teaches : 

Practical psychology directs 'first of all its ener- 
gies in controlling the unconscious, and we know 
that we can do it. Why? Because we know the 
cause of the unconscious is the conscious ; the 
unconscious thoughts are the submerged millions 
of our old conscious thoughts, old conscious actions 
become petrified — we do not look at them, do not 
know them, have forgotten them. But mind you, 
if the power of evil is in the unconscious, so also is 
the power of good. We have many things stored 
in us as in a pocket. We have forgotten them, do 
not even think of them, and there are many of 
them, rotting, becoming positively dangerous ; they 
come forth, the unconscious causes which kill 
humanity. True psychology would, therefore, try 
to bring them under the control of the conscious. 
The great task is to revive the whole man, as it 
were, in order to make him the complete master 
of himself. Even what we call the automatic action 
of the organs within our bodies such as the liver 
etc, can be made to obey our .commands,. 69 

But control of the unconscious' does not 
accomplish the entire task on hand. There is 



sa Op. cit, Vol II, 1963, p. 34. 
wibid., ^ 35. 



CONTROL OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND 95 

more to it. So Swami Vivekanancla teaches: 

This is the first part of the study, the control 
of the unconscious. The next is to go beyond the 
conscious. Just as unconscious work is beneath 
consciousness, so there is another work which is 
above consciousness. When this super conscious 
state is reached man becomes free and divine ; 
death becomes immortality, weakness becomes in- 
finite power, and iron bondage becomes liberty. 
That is the goal, the infinite realm, of the super- 
cons cjpus. 00 

To clinch his teaching on this subject he 
says: 

So, therefore, we see now that there must be a 
twofold work. First, by the proper working the 
ida and the pingalu, which are the two existing 
ordinary currents, to control the subconscious 
action ; and secondly, to go beyond even con- 
sciousness. 

The books say that he alone is the yogi who, 
after long practice in self- concentration, has attain- 
ed to this truth. The m$umna now opens and a 
current which never before entered into this new 
passage will find its way into it, and gradually 
ascend to (what we call in figurative language) 
the different lotus centres, till at last it reacbes 
the brain. Then the yogi becomes conscious of 
what he really is, God Himself. 91 

The reference here is to the awakening of 
kundalini through the Raja-Yoga method of 
pranayama, which is an aid in the control of 
one's mind. Frtin&yama, however, as. we have 

90 Ibid., p. 35. 
01 Ibid., pp. 35-36. 



ok THE MIND AND 3TS CONTROL 

mentioned before, is to be learnt personally 
from an expert teacher who is not easy to find, 
Those who are continent and earnest aspirants 
and who are fortunate to have such a teacher, 
may well learn from him and their task of 
controlling the mind will be easier. But the 
greater number of those who struggle with 
their mind and want to control it may neither 
live in a very congenial atmosphere Jjpr prac- 
tising pranayama, for example in a smog-filled 
modern city, nor have the opportunity t of 
learning the discipline from an expert teacher. 
Most of them, therefore, must depend upon 
other disciplines which can be as effective if 
practised with faith and diligence. Repetition 
of Orn while meditating on its meaning is the 
most efficacious of these practices. 

When the kuncjalim, the latent spiritual power, 
is awakened in a person, the control of the 
subconscious mind, which is hard to handle, is 
taken care of. But, in fact, the Raja-Yoga 
method of awakening the kundalim cannot be 
easily practised by the vast majority of people. 

Fortunately, there are other disciplines 
through the practice of which one's spiritual 
consciousness can be awakened. 

Sri Ramakrishna teaches; * 

r 

One's spiritual consciousness is not awakened by 
merely reading books. One should also pray to 



CONTROL OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND 




God. The kuntfalirii is roused if the aspirant feels 
restless for God. 93 

...The kuntfalini is speedily awakened if one 
follows the path of bhakti. 9 * 

One day a disciple asked Swami Brahma- 
nanda, 'Sir, how can the kundalim be roused?* 

The Swanu" replied: 

According to some there are some exercises, but 
t believe it can be best done through repetition 
of (he Divine Name and meditation. Specially 
suited to our age is the practice of japam or con- 
stant repetition of God's name and meditation upon 
it. There is no spiritual practice easier than this. 
But meditation must accompany the repetition of 
the mantra (the mystic word). * 

Thus, by the practice of the spiritual disci- 
plines of the path of bhakti, such as prayer, 
repetition 6i the Divine Name, and meditation, 
our spiritual potency is awakened. And this 
awakened power easily takes care of the diffi- 
culties of the subconscious mind. So no one 
need be in despair thinking that because he is 
unable to practise Raja-Yoga disciplines his 
way to controlling the subconscious mind is 
closed. No, it is not, for there is none so help- 
less in this world that he cannot repeat the 
Divine Name. If there is, his time for con- 
trolling the mind is not yet.

BEWARE OF A TRICK OF THE MIND 




We must know that the mind sometimes 
plays a trick on itself, that is to say, the sub- 
conscious mind on the .cdnscious. When we 
are struggling with temptation or weakness on 
the conscious level, suddenly the picture of a 
more difficult situation flashes before our mind's 
eye, and fear-stricken we wonder: 'What shall 
I do if I am beset with such difficulties?* In 
worrying about our future, our present topples 
over. Being off guard, we are swept away by 
the present temptation. 

How do we prevent this sabotage? We can 
do so by simply clarifying our idea of time. 
As Meister Eckhart, the German mystic, says: 
'In the heart of this moment is eternity/ We 
must clearly see that every moment is only 
this moment If we have taken care of this 
oment, we have taken care of our entire 
uture. If we do not submit to temptation only 
or this moment, and always only for this 
moment, we never shall submit to it. 

Therefore, whatever situation we may be in, 
let us stand firm in our resolution this moment, 
and we shall succeed. The future is nothing 



RELIEVERS ARE AT AN ADVANTAGE

but Maya. It is foolishness to worry about the 
future while allowing the devil to conquer the 
present. 

The challenge of spiritual life is very simple: 
to be good, truly moral and master of our- 
selves for only this moment. What time is 
there outside this moment, that we should 
worry about it? 



29 



BELIEVERS ARE AT AN ADVANTAGE 
IN CONTROLLING THE MIND 



Those who believe in God have a distinct 
advantage over those who do not believe, as 
far as mind-control is concerned. When faith 
in God is sincerely cultivated, we get potent 
help for controlling the mind. Through the 
practice of devotion, zeal for God is developed ; 
and this zeal for God can work wonders by 
way of removing obstructions to the control 
of the mind. In the words of Sri Ramakrishna: 

As the tiger devours other animals, so does the 
'tiger of the zeal for the Lord' eat up lust, anger 





100 THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 

and other passions. Once this zeal grows in the 
heart, lust and the other passions disappear. The 
gopis of Vrindavan had that state of mind because 
of their seal for Krsna. 95 

■ ■ • 

When lust, anger and other passions dis- 
appear the mind becomes purified. A pure 
mind is easily controlled. But the non-believer 
will have to work at it the hard and long way, 
for, unless he gives up his unbelief, he cannot 
develop zeal for God. • 

Sri Krsna teaches: 

* » « 

Even a devotee (not to speak of a saint) of Mine 
who is not the master of his senses and is troubled 
by sense-objects, is generally not overcome by 
them owing to his powerful devotion. 00 

The psychological process through which 
purity of mind comes to the believer is simple. 
When he develops love for God, his mind 
dwells on Him, for we naturally concentrate 
on whatever we love. We assimilate the quali- 
ties of whatever we concentrate our mind on. 
Therefore when we concentrate our mind on 
God, we assimilate what the Gitd calls daivi 
sampad, divine qualities. 97 Purity of heart, 
control of the senses, absence of anger, , tran- 
quillity, absence of fickleness are some of the

divine qualities which $ true lover of God gets 
without deliberately striving for them. In 
other words he attains control of the mind in 
a spontaneous way. 



30 



THE SIMPLEST AND THE SUREST METHOD 
OF CONTROLLING THE MIND 



We have said a few things about methods of 
controlling the mind. But one truth will bear 
repetition* And this truth is laid much stress 
upon both by Sri Ramakrishna and Holy 
Mother. Sri Ramakrishna teaches: 

The best thing for people whose minds are 
attracted by sense-objects is to cultivate the dualis- 
tic attitude and chant loudly the name of the Lord 
as enjoined in the Narada Pancaratra.* 9 

On another occasion Sri Ramakrishna said to 
a devotee: 

Through the path of devotion subtle senses come 
readily and naturally under control. Carnal

pleasures become more and more insipid as divine 
Jove grows in your heart. Can the pleasures of 
the body attract the husband and the wife on 
the day their child has died? 

Devotee: But I have not learnt to love God? 



Sri Ramakrishna; Take His name constantly/ 
This will cleanse all sin, lust and anger, and all 
desires for the pleasures of the body will vanish, 

■ 

Devotee : But I do not find delight in His name. 

Sri Ramakrishna: Then pray with a yearning 
heart that He may teach you to relish His name, 
Undoubtedly He will grant your prayer... *I 
find no delight in Thy name — * If a delirious 
patient loses all taste for food, despair of his life. 
But if he relishes food even slightly, you may hope 
for his recovery. So I say, 'Find joy in His name*. 
Durga, Krsna, Siva — any name will do. And if 
you daily feel greater attraction for taking His 
name and a greater joy in it, you need fear no 
more. The delirium must he cured, and His grace 
will surely descend on you," 

The same truth comes to us equally forcefully 
from Holy Mother's life and teaching: ' 






The mother was seated on her bed. The disciple 
was reading to her letters written by her devotees. 
The letters contained such statements as: 'The 
mind cannot be controlled etc/ The Holy Mother 
listened to these and said in rather an animated 
voice, 'The mind will be steadied if one repeats 
the name of God fifteen to twenty thousand times 
a day. It is truly so. I myself have experienced

complain. One should practise japam with some 
devotion, but this is not done. They will not do 
anything; .they will only complain saying "Why 
do I not succeed?" * 100 

An easier and more potent method of 
controlling the mind than the one explained by 
Holy Mother is not known to man. But one 
must be simple in heart to accept and prac- 
tise it. Let us test these words of the Holy 
Mother for ourselves and see whether or not 
they come true in our lives. 

But this warning should be given that for 
a beginner to repeat the name of the Lord 
twenty thousand times a day suddenly* may 
not be -advisable. One should begin modestly 
and through regular practice steadily increase 
the number under the guidance of the Guru. 
The most important thing is to begin doing 
something in the right direction now. 

Earnest prayer to God every day at regular 
hours for good intentions and purity of the 
mind— - which is the same as the controlled 
state of mind — will greatly help. Sincere 
prayers are answered, says Sri Ramakrishna. 

As our practice of prayer grows in intensity 
one result will ensue. Gradually we shall notice 
that the character of our prayer has been

changing: it has become more God-centred 
than object-centred. We have become more 
interested in God than in what we want from 
Him. Asking has been transmuted into love of 
God. It is this love of Cod which is the most 
important factor in controlling the mind. 

In the beginning this love may appear to be 
absent in our hearts, or very faint even if it is 
there. But through various methods — such as 
holy company, repetition of the Lord's name, 
study of the lives and teachings of saints, 
ritualistic worship, devotional singing — this 
love may gradually grow in us. As it becomes 
a strong force within us, we easily overcome 
inimical inner forces which cause non-control of 
the mind. A time comes in a person's life 
when the mind spontaneously gravitates towards 
the object of supreme love. In such a state of 
mind bliss is experienced. When we are con- 
firmed in this state we shall have attained the 
controlled state of mind automatically. 

So the most complete answer to the question, 
How to control the mind? is: Love God. But 
if you do not believe in God, then believe in 
yourself. Exercise your will and transcend the 
gunas by self-effort. By this means also you 
will gain control of your mind. 

In any case, for the believer as for the non- 
believer, a way of controlling the mind always

remains open. There is no greater blessing in 
life than a controlled state of mind. Let us 
do our very best to acquire it, for this will 
lead us to the greatest of blessings. 



A SUMMARY 



Mind-control has always, been a difficult task 
even for a heroic person ; but it is not an 
impossible one. There are well-defined methods. 

The entire secret of controlling the mind is 
given by Sri Krsna in the two words abhydsa 
and vairagya, practice and dispassion. 

To bring these two disciplines into the 
stream of our life: we have to develop a 
strong will to control the mind ; we have to 
understand the nature of our mind ; we have 
to learn certain techniques and practise them. 

In order to strengthen the will, we need to 
overcome our pleasure-motive and' also under- 
stand what is involved in controlling the mind. 

The nature of the mind is explained from 
8

HIE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 



the Hindu point of view in The Complete 
Works of Swami Vivekananda. 

To be able to control our mind we must 
know how not to make our task unnecessarily 
difficult. 

Mind-control is the personal task of the 
person concerned. The object of mind-control 
is the realization of our absolute oneness with 
the Divine. For this no price can be too great 
to pay. 

To be able to practise effectively the disci- 
plines leading to mind-control we need a 
favourable inner climate. This includes the 
capacity to accept certain features of life as 
inevitable. 

For controlling the mind we need two sets 
of inner disciplines: one to give a healthy 
general direction to the mind, and the other to 
save us in emergencies. 

The purer the mind, the easier it is to control. 
So we should practise disciplines for the 
purification of the mind. Our object should be 
to bring about a preponderance of sattw in 
our inner nature, and then to transcend sattva 
by purifying it according * to authentic disci- 
plines. 




A SUMMARY JQ7 

The easiest method of doing tins, however, 
is cultivating holy company. 

The Vedantic disciplines can be helpfully 
supplemented by the Yoga disciplines taught 
by Patafijali. 

Along with the practice of the disciplines of 
Yoga should go the practice of discrimination. 
Then we shall be able to train the mind to 
behave. When it has been trained to behave, 
the senses will have been trained not to come 
in contact with their objects, but to obey the 
mind. Then pratydhara will have been achieved. 

Certain ancillary measures which greatly 
help the effective practice of the main disci- 
plines should be given attention. These 
measures are: keeping our human relationships 
in order ; giving the mind a healthy occupation ; 
making right use of the imagination; and 
guarding against despondency. 

Mind-control is greatly helped by the practice 
of meditation, and meditation by mind-control. 

In explosive inner situations to apply high- 
power emergency brakes, Patafijalfs teaching 
is: practise thinking contrary thoughts. Cease- 
less chanting of the Lords name and also taking 
refuge in God help.

THE MIND AND ITS CONTROL 



Methodical control of thought is a great 
secret in controlling the mind. 

Without controlling the subconscious, the 
mind cannot be controlled. The subconscious 
can be controlled by pouring holy thought into 
it, as it were, and by the practice of Prdnaydma 
and other disciplines, among which is bhaktL 
These rouse the kundalinl, the latent spiritual 
power in a person. 

We must beware of a harmful kind of imag- 
ination. By being truly moral only for this 
moment, and then at the next moment for the 
next moment, and so on always we can guard 
against such a possibility. 

Believers are at an advantage in controlling 
the mind. 

The simplest and surest method of control- 
ling the mind is through love of God. 

Those who do not believe in God can control 
the mind by transcending the gunas through 
self -effort. 

Mind-control is valuable because it leads to 
the highest blessing — the illumined state of 
being,

PREFACE TO THE FIRST REPRINT 



The first edition of The Mind and Its Control 
having gone out of print much earlier than 
expected — within five months of its publica- 
tion — we are now reprinting it with a few 
improvements here and there in the text. 

It is likely to be increasingly realized every- 
where in the world that man's well-being is 
inseparable from mind-control Hence we hope 
that the circulation of this small book will 
steadily widen.

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION 



The control of the mind is a theme of 
universal interest. It personally concerns every 
spiritual seeker belonging to any religion. 
Religion in its applied aspect has to grapple 
with this problem. No fundamental work for 



In this publication the text of the original 
article has been revised ; certain points have 
been further elucidated; and some points have 
been added. A summary and glossary have 
been provided. 

It is hoped that this small book, which 
addresses itself to one of the central problems 
of life, may be of service.

the uplift of the individual or the community 
can ever be done without mind-control. Hence 
its compelling claim on our attention. 

Among those who seek to control their 
minds there are different kinds of people: 
atheists, believers, agnostics, and those who are 
indifferent to religion. Ways of controlling the 
mind are open to all these kinds of people, 
though the true believer in God may be at an 
advantage in that genuine love of God can to 
a considerable degree simplify his problems 
with the mind. This book, however, is written 
for all. A detached inquirer will keep his mind 
open to all the methods of controlling the 
mind, 

Vedanta and Yoga have much to teach about 
die nature of the mind and the ways of 
controlling it. In his treatment the author has 
largely depended on such information and 
enlightenment as the authentic scriptures and 
teachers of Vedanta and Yoga provide, 

The Mind and Its Control was first serialized 
in the 'Essays on Applied Religion column in 
the October, November and December 1970 
issues of Prabuddha Bharata* It attracted the 
attention of some readers, one of whom 
generously offered to contribute towards the 
cost of its production as a book for wider 
circulation, Our thanks are due to that friend.
