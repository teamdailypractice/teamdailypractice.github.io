* **Who is responsible for the way I am right now, this moment?**

* my wife/husband?
* my children?
* my birthplace?
* my school?
* my teachers?
* my college?
* my friends?
* my job?

* ...

## What is possible to fix/change at this moment for the good for myself?

* Others behaviour towards me?
* Environment's behaviour towards me?
* I choose to think, act in a way that is good for my body, mind. I choose my thoughts and my actions

## Do I have a choice to choose, how I should be this moment, here, now?

* Do any one really have any influence over how I should be this moment?
* The only one who has control over how I should be this moment is myself?
* Do I use the power I have?
