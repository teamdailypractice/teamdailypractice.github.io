        <h1>Chapter 7: Motion</h1>
    <h2>Introduction to Motion</h2><h3>Motion is Everywhere</h3><p>In everyday life, we see objects at rest and in motion. Birds fly, cars move, and blood flows. Even atoms, planets, and stars are in motion.</p><h3>Perception of Motion</h3><p>We often perceive an object to be in motion when its position changes with time. Sometimes motion is inferred indirectly, like observing dust movement to know the wind is blowing.</p><h3>Relative Motion</h3><p>An object may appear moving to one person and stationary to another. For example, roadside trees appear to move backwards to passengers in a moving bus, but are stationary to a person on the road.</p><h2>Describing Motion</h2><h3>Reference Point</h3><p>To describe the location of an object, we specify a reference point called the origin. For example, if a school is 2 km north of the railway station, the station is the reference point.</p><h2>Motion Along a Straight Line</h2><h3>Distance</h3><p>The total path length covered by an object is the distance. It has only magnitude (numerical value) and no direction.</p><h3>Displacement</h3><p>The shortest distance measured from the initial to the final position of an object is known as displacement. It has both magnitude and direction.</p><h3>Difference</h3><p>The magnitude of displacement can be zero (if the object returns to the start), but the distance covered will not be zero.</p><h2>Uniform and Non-Uniform Motion</h2><h3>Uniform Motion</h3><p>If an object covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, it is said to be in uniform motion.</p><h3>Non-Uniform Motion</h3><p>If an object covers unequal distances in equal intervals of time, it is in non-uniform motion. Example: A car moving on a crowded street.</p><h2>Measuring the Rate of Motion</h2><h3>Speed</h3><p>The distance travelled by an object in unit time is called speed. The SI unit is metre per second (m/s).</p><h3>Average Speed</h3><p>Since speed is often not constant, we use average speed. Average speed = Total distance travelled / Total time taken.</p><h2>Speed with Direction: Velocity</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Velocity is the speed of an object moving in a definite direction. It specifies both magnitude and direction.</p><h3>Changing Velocity</h3><p>Velocity can change by changing the object's speed, direction of motion, or both.</p><h3>Average Velocity</h3><p>If velocity changes at a uniform rate, Average velocity = (Initial velocity + Final velocity) / 2.</p><h2>Rate of Change of Velocity: Acceleration</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Acceleration is the measure of the change in the velocity of an object per unit time. Acceleration = (Change in velocity) / (Time taken).</p><h3>Formula</h3><p>If velocity changes from u (initial) to v (final) in time t, then acceleration a = (v - u) / t. The SI unit is m/s².</p><h3>Uniform Acceleration</h3><p>If velocity changes by equal amounts in equal time intervals, acceleration is uniform (e.g., a freely falling body).</p><h2>Graphical Representation: Distance-Time Graphs</h2><h3>Uniform Speed</h3><p>For an object moving with uniform speed, the distance-time graph is a straight line. The slope of the line indicates the speed.</p><h3>Non-Uniform Speed</h3><p>For non-uniform speed, the graph is a curved line, showing non-linear variation of distance with time.</p><h2>Velocity-Time Graphs</h2><h3>Uniform Motion</h3><p>If an object moves at uniform velocity, the graph is a straight line parallel to the time axis. The area under the graph gives the displacement.</p><h3>Uniform Acceleration</h3><p>For uniformly accelerated motion, the velocity-time graph is a straight line. The area under the graph gives the distance travelled.</p><h2>Equations of Motion</h2><h3>The Three Equations</h3><p>For an object moving along a straight line with uniform acceleration: 1) v = u + at (Velocity-time relation), 2) s = ut + ½at² (Position-time relation), 3) 2as = v² - u² (Position-velocity relation).</p><h3>Symbols</h3><p>u = initial velocity, v = final velocity, a = acceleration, t = time, s = distance.</p><h2>Uniform Circular Motion</h2><h3>Accelerated Motion</h3><p>When an object moves in a circular path with uniform speed, its direction changes continuously. Therefore, the velocity changes, making it an accelerated motion.</p><h3>Examples</h3><p>Examples include the motion of the moon around the earth, a satellite in orbit, or a stone tied to a thread and whirled in a circle.</p><h3>Formula</h3><p>Speed v = (2πr) / t, where r is the radius of the circular path and t is the time taken for one round.</p></body></html>
