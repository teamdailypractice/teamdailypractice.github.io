        <h1>Chapter 10: Work and Energy</h1>
    <h2>Introduction to Work and Energy</h2><h3>Life Processes</h3><p>All living beings need food for energy to perform basic activities. We also need energy for playing, singing, reading, etc.</p><h3>Machines</h3><p>Machines also need energy for their working. Some engines require fuel like petrol and diesel.</p><h3>Connection</h3><p>Work, energy, and power are closely related concepts that help us understand natural phenomena.</p><h2>Scientific Conception of Work</h2><h3>Difference in Meaning</h3><p>There is a difference between 'work' in day-to-day life and 'work' in science. Mental labour like studying is not considered work in science.</p><h3>No Displacement, No Work</h3><p>Pushing a huge rock that doesn't move involves a lot of effort but no work is done on the rock because there is no displacement.</p><h2>Two Conditions for Work</h2><h3>The Conditions</h3><p>For work to be done in science, two conditions must be satisfied: (i) a force should act on an object, and (ii) the object must be displaced.</p><h3>Examples</h3><p>A girl pulling a trolley is doing work because force is applied and displacement occurs. A book lifted up involves work.</p><h2>Work Done by a Constant Force</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Work done by a force acting on an object is equal to the magnitude of the force multiplied by the distance moved in the direction of the force.</p><h3>Formula</h3><p>Work (W) = Force (F) × Displacement (s). Work has only magnitude and no direction.</p><h3>Unit</h3><p>The unit of work is newton metre (N m) or joule (J). 1 J is the work done when a force of 1 N displaces an object by 1 m.</p><h2>Positive and Negative Work</h2><h3>Positive Work</h3><p>Work done is positive when the force is in the direction of displacement. Example: A baby pulling a toy car parallel to the ground.</p><h3>Negative Work</h3><p>Work done is negative when the force acts opposite to the direction of displacement. Example: Retarding force applied to a moving object.</p><h2>Energy</h2><h3>Capacity to Do Work</h3><p>An object having a capability to do work is said to possess energy. The object doing work loses energy, and the object on which work is done gains energy.</p><h3>Measurement</h3><p>Energy possessed by an object is measured in terms of its capacity of doing work. The unit of energy is the same as work: joule (J).</p><h3>Sources</h3><p>The Sun is the biggest natural source of energy. Other sources include nuclei of atoms, interior of earth, and tides.</p><h2>Forms of Energy</h2><h3>Variety</h3><p>Energy exists in many forms: mechanical energy (potential + kinetic), heat energy, chemical energy, electrical energy, and light energy.</p><h2>Kinetic Energy</h2><h3>Energy of Motion</h3><p>Kinetic energy is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion. A moving bullet, blowing wind, and a running athlete possess kinetic energy.</p><h3>Speed Factor</h3><p>The kinetic energy of an object increases with its speed. An object moving faster can do more work than an identical object moving relatively slow.</p><h2>Formula for Kinetic Energy</h2><h3>Derivation</h3><p>Work done to accelerate an object from velocity u to v is the change in kinetic energy. If starting from rest (u=0), Work = ½mv².</p><h3>Formula</h3><p>Kinetic Energy (Ek) = ½mv², where m is the mass and v is the velocity.</p><h2>Potential Energy</h2><h3>Stored Energy</h3><p>The energy transferred to an object is stored as potential energy if it is not used to cause a change in velocity. It is the energy present by virtue of position or configuration.</p><h3>Examples</h3><p>Stretching a rubber band or winding a toy car stores potential energy.</p><h2>Potential Energy of an Object at a Height</h2><h3>Gravitational Potential Energy</h3><p>When an object is raised through a height, work is done against gravity. The energy gained is gravitational potential energy.</p><h3>Formula</h3><p>Ep = mgh, where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity, and h is the height.</p><h3>Path Independence</h3><p>The work done by gravity depends on the difference in vertical heights, not on the path taken.</p><h2>Interconversion of Energy</h2><h3>Transformation</h3><p>Energy can be converted from one form to another. In nature, green plants convert solar energy to chemical energy (food).</p><h3>Gadgets</h3><p>Many human activities and gadgets involve energy conversion, like an electric bulb converting electrical energy to light and heat.</p><h2>Law of Conservation of Energy</h2><h3>Statement</h3><p>Energy can only be converted from one form to another; it can neither be created nor destroyed. The total energy before and after the transformation remains the same.</p><h3>Free Fall Example</h3><p>During free fall, potential energy decreases while kinetic energy increases. The sum (mechanical energy) remains constant at all points: mgh + ½mv² = constant.</p><h2>Rate of Doing Work (Power)</h2><h3>Definition</h3><p>Power is defined as the rate of doing work or the rate of transfer of energy. Power = Work / Time.</p><h3>Unit</h3><p>The unit of power is watt (W). 1 W = 1 Joule/second. Larger unit is kilowatt (kW).</p><h3>Average Power</h3><p>Since power may vary with time, we use average power = Total energy consumed / Total time taken.</p><h2>Commercial Unit of Energy</h2><h3>Kilowatt-hour</h3><p>The joule is too small for large energy quantities. We use kilowatt-hour (kWh). 1 kWh is the energy used in one hour at the rate of 1000 J/s.</p><h3>Conversion</h3><p>1 kWh = 3.6 x 10^6 J. This is commonly known as one 'unit' of electricity.</p><script src="navbar.js"></script></body></html>
