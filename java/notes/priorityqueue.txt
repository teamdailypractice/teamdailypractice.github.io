Here's a practical example - for a business application:

Scenario/application/use case/real life:
You're running a hospital and patients are coming in
There's only one doctor on staff

How is the working?

The first man walks in - and he's served immediately. 

Next, a man with a cold comes in and requires assistance. 
You add him to the queue and he waits in line for the doctor to become available. 

Next, a man with an axe in his head comes through the door. 
He is assigned a higher priority because he has a higher medical liability.
So the man with the cold is bumped down in line. 

Next, someone comes in with breathing problems. 
So, once again, the man with the cold is bumped down in priority. 
This is called triaging in the real world - but in this case it's a medical line.

Implementing this in code would use: 
priority queue
a worker thread (the doctor) to perform work 
on the consumable / units of work (the patients)
