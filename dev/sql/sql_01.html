     <h3>
      What is a DBMS?
     </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
     <p>
      DBMS is a software that manages the storage and retrieval of data

      What is a RDBMS?

     <p>
      RDBMS (relational database management system)
     </p>
     <p>
      store data in a tabular form

      The tables will have an identifier called primary key

     <h3>
      DBMS vs RDBMS
     </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
     <p>
      The key difference is that RDBMS (relational database management system) store data in a tabular form, while DBMS applications store data as files.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      In a RDBMS, the tables will have an identifier called primary key.  RDBMS, everything is stored as table

     <h3>
      Normalization
     </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
     <p>
      The process of reducing data redundancy and improving data integrity is called normalization.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      Data redundancy - Ensure data is kept only in one table. For example, in a Shopping cart application database, keep the customer information should be designed as follows
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      Data Integrity - the accuracy and consistency of data stored in a database. Refers to ACID property of the database
     </p>
     <p>
      A - Atomic
     </p>
     <p>
      C - Consistent
     </p>
     <p>
      I - Isolation
     </p>
     <p>
      D - Durability

     <h3>
      What is ACID property of database?
     </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
     <p>
      ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps
     </p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
     <h3>
      What is a transaction in database?
     </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
     <p>
      Sequence of database operations that satisfies the ACID properties (which can be perceived as a single logical operation on the data) is called a transaction.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      Example - Withdrawing money from ATM is a transaction.
     </p>
     <p>
      1. Customer account is debited
     </p>
     <p>
      2. Customer has received the money from ATM machine
     </p>
     <p>
      Either both should succeed or none should succeed to ensure the database transaction is ACID compliant

    <div class="question">
     <h3>
      What is a Clustered index?
     </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
     <p>
      With a clustered index the rows are stored physically on the disk in the same order as the index.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      Therefore, there can be only one clustered index. Why? As items can be arranged in only one specific order at a given point of time, there can be only one clustered index
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      It is generally faster to read from a clustered index if you want to get back all the columns.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      You do not have to go first to the index and then to the table.
     </p>
     <p>
     </p>
     <p>
      Writing to a table with a clustered index can be slower, if there is a need to rearrange the data.
     </p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
     <h3>
      What is a non-clustered index?
     </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
     <p>
      With a non clustered index there is a second list that has pointers to the physical rows. You can have many non clustered indices, although each new index will increase the time it takes to write new records.
     </p>

    <div class="question">
     <h3>
      What is the advantage of Clustered index?
     </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
     <p>
      Reading data from the table would be faster if the SELECT query has WHERE condition based on the column/columns through which clustered index is created
     </p>

     <h3>
      What is the disadvantage of Clustered index?
     </h3>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
     <p>
      Writing to a table with a clustered index can be slower, if there is a need to rearrange the data, on insert/update/delete of data.
